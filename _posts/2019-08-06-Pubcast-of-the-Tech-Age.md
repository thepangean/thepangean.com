The first of The Pangean's *pubcasts* is with [Dr Miranda Mowbray](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mirandamowbray/), a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Bristol. After having graduated from the University of Cambridge and completing her PhD in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London, Dr Mowbray gained several years of experience in industry and is now pursuing research into data science for cybersecurity, and ethics for big data.

In this podcast, [Harsh Tiwari](https://thepangean.com/author/harsh.tiwari/) and [Reuben Pritchard](https://thepangean.com/author/reuben.pritchard/) sit down with Dr Miranda Mowbray and, over lunch and a couple of pints, discuss some pressing matters surrounding the age of technology.
