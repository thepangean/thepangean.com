Most of us in some way, shape or form love social media. We spend hours
scrolling through content, liking and commenting as we go along. All of our
actions generate data which is then collected by these social media companies
and used, to encourage us to use their platforms more: the so-called addictive
factor. The more data a social media platform collects, the larger their profit
margins. Not only do we consume content, but we also partake in the creation of
content which further keeps users on these platforms.

Let’s take Instagram for example. When you upload a photo of yourself on a beach
holiday in Mauritius, it is added to the collective of all posts by Instagram.
Now Instagram is going to do its best to get as many people to view, like and
comment on your post. This brings two benefits to them. One, it learns about the
consumer's preferences and interests based on what they look at. Two, each
notification you receive about that post will trigger a dopamine response making
you more likely to click on it and get back on the app. Now you can see from
just one post, Instagram is able to keep your followers on the app as well as
yourself. And every additional action carried out on Instagram generates a data
point on us to be sold to the highest bidder.

Social media sites are also designed to make it as easy as possible for us to
post something. By studying how we use the app, [UI/UX designers are further
improving apps to make creating content a force of
habit](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/habits-five-ways-to-help-users-change-them).
These habits slowly meld into our lives to the point we don’t even have to think
before carrying out all the actions required to open Facebook on our phones and
get onto a Livestream. Now that we have come full circle, we realise the
horrible truth, that we are the creators of our own downfall.

<blockquote>
<em>“Social media, it’s just the market’s answer to a generation that demanded to
perform. So the market said, ‘Here, perform everything to each other, all the
time, for no reason.’ It’s prison. It’s horrific. It is performer and audience
melded together,”</em> He then goes on to add, <em>“I know very little about anything,
but what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience, you
should do it.”</em> - Bo Burnham's comedy special <em>Make Happy</em>.
</blockquote>

So what does this mean for us? Once you understand how social media works, you
begin to realise that the platforms only have power because we give it to them.
And if we can give them the power, we can also take it back. Sometimes it feels
like one person can't make a difference, but much like democracy, every single
person counts. The next time you find yourself appalled by Facebook's unethical
data practices. Just stop and think for a little, how much of an accomplice are
you?

Social media is a great tool to connect, discover and learn but failure to
understand the machinations behind how social media works can lead us down a
vicious cycle of consumption. Sometimes all we need to take control... is to
take a step back.
