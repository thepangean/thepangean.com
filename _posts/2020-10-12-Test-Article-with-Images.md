<p>Shinzo Abe announced that he was resigning from his post on August 28, 2020. He stated that he was doing so in light of extreme health issues, and apologised to the people of Japan for failing to complete his term in the office and for leaving the nation in a period of political uncertainty. At the age of 65 years, Abe suffers from a chronic condition called ‘ulcerative colitis’, which he was diagnosed with when he was a teenager. It is an inflammatory bowel disease that has accentuated recently, prompting him to take this drastic precaution for his health. He had resigned even earlier in 2007 due to this condition. After this, his new period in the office started in 2012, and he has been loved by his people ever since.</p><p><strong ><em>‘Abenomics'</em></strong></p><p><a href="https://thepangean.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" ><em><div class='caption' style='text-align: left'><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/slsIXVC3zyCu9LcqXHyNk_PVvU46hJe8_dkwxLa3uVMx9WC1jbObQHKR5yAc1ivXMN21DL0yljtJ0EqrSFPuuiyE7bDxn7eTww5ILxak85NB4-U5LlIUogA_L0YI4XrQI5cQ0vVC"  >First Caption</div></em></a>A member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), his reputation is that of a strong nationalist and conservative. His right tilted political front with the Liberal Democratic Party has boosted its popularity. Abe has led it in both the houses of Japanese Parliament. He has developed a stronghold in economic policy on a self-named programme known as 'Abenomics', which he introduced in 2012. An output plan to jumpstart Japan's economy, it has been focussed on the stagnant growth of monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms. The success of Abenomics has resulted in a double-edged sword with him aggressively focusing on the first two promises, yet sorely lacking in structural reform. Although his win in the consecutive elections has not been entirely because of this policy, it has played a crucial role. Mr Shinzo Abe has mostly been lauded for his representation as a modicum of stability in Japanese political history.</p><p><a href="http://thepangean.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" ><div class='caption' style='text-align: left'><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Zy0EhYFsdRl1tInH9vK8H-eknjPsZkLf7stwfHYBHwglThL9T1t3uIXlgsMUuW1AQSnVONUVAj4jea_xIDuxZgOvT7WvVJK_6XMLdEmc0V1OFKc5uKUSsjfx5_hssb622eYTnEoI"  >Second Caption</div></a></p>
