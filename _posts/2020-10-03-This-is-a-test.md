<p><strong >WEAPONISED WORDS: A TALE OF HATE SPEECH&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Newton Lee once said, “There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. Free speech encourages debate whereas hate speech incites violence.”&nbsp;</p><p>This quotation is a constant reminder of how easily hate speech overlaps with the idea of freedom of expression.&nbsp;Over the past few months, the challenge of separating hate speech from the Indian citizen’s right to ‘Freedom of Expression’ has increased tremendously. Recently, several citizens including journalists, political party leaders and activists have been charged with hate speech, inflammatory speech and sedition. On one hand, offended plaintiffs file FIRs due to hurt caused to their sentiments by the comments of the accused people. On the other hand, the defendants perceive it as a violation of their right to Freedom of Speech.&nbsp;</p><p>In the light of recent incidents in India, a crucial question arises.&nbsp;Should hate speech be incorporated as a part of Freedom of Speech, or should hate speech be legally regulated?&nbsp;</p><p>In order to scrutinise the idea of ‘free hate speech’, it is important to distinguish between the two ideas of hate speech and free speech.&nbsp;"Freedom of Expression or Speech" is a principle supporting the idea of an individual or a community articulating their opinions and ideas freely. It ensures such freedom “without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.” On the other hand, hate speech is clearly defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as "public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation”.</p><p>To get a sense of how hate speech is treated by the legislation, we must look at a few examples. While hate speech is not a legal term in some countries, victims of hate speech may seek redressal under civil law, criminal law, or both in other nations. For instance, in the United States, hate speech is constitutionally protected. On the contrary, de jure, freedom of expression is promised in North Korea but there is no de facto right to free speech as asserted by Amnesty International, a human rights group.&nbsp;</p>
