      <content type="html" xml:base="/Rise-of-the-Screen-Killer">&lt;p&gt;Internet culture has pervaded scriptwriting in various ways. It has provided
useful ways of releasing information to the audience. Meme culture, ways of
writing texts, or communication through a certain type of media reveals a
subtext previously unknown, but in every conversation that follows, you consider
these subtexts to figure out how the situation will unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the BBC masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Sherlock is quite often in
contact with his arch-nemesis Jim Moriarty, and we know that through the message
bubbles which pop up on the screen for us to see whilst we simultaneously
observe Sherlock’s expressions. &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt; portrays the internet the best -
take an episode like &lt;em&gt;Nosedive&lt;/em&gt;; a brutal, horrifying account of what happens if
we introduce a social credit rating for humans or &lt;em&gt;Shut Up And Dance&lt;/em&gt;; an
episode that’ll instantly make you cover your webcam with some tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These, however, are still conventional ways of storytelling. Even though the
aforementioned devices make use of internet culture, they still fall short of
being able to harness the full power of what someone experiences when online.
The need to harness and depict that is what led to the &lt;em&gt;computer screen
thriller&lt;/em&gt; being born - a stylish new method of movie-making. Most or all of the
film takes place on some kind of a screen be it the computer, phone or
television. This subgenre of films made its biggest splash with the release of
&lt;em&gt;Searching&lt;/em&gt;, a movie with John Cho playing the lead, about a father searching
for his missing daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the roots of this subgenre go back way before 2018. The first
documented screen-only movie was &lt;em&gt;The Collingswood Story&lt;/em&gt;, which is about an
online long-distance relationship gone wrong. It takes place through webcams.
The real wave of this subgenre started about a decade later with the movie
&lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt;, which revolved around cyberbullying among high-school students. It
made $64 million in revenue against a budget of $1 million. A Russian
director, Timur Bekmambetov co-produced it, thereby beginning his dedication to
this subgenre that he calls &lt;em&gt;Screen Life&lt;/em&gt;. He produced a sequel to the movie, as
well as &lt;em&gt;Searching,&lt;/em&gt; and directed one of his own called &lt;em&gt;Profile.&lt;/em&gt; There were
other short films in and around 2013-2015, which seemingly inspired the TV show
&lt;em&gt;Modern Family&lt;/em&gt; to go the same route with one of their episodes. It is hailed by
many as one of the best episodes of the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question, however, is this: is there something much deeper to the
Screen Life or is it just a gimmick to make things flashy? Much of the
information can be revealed without using screens throughout. &lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt; was
able to demonstrate it well. The TV show &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt; was themed around
internet culture, and used it to its advantage. Even &lt;em&gt;13 Reasons Why&lt;/em&gt; could be
credited for the same; one can see that this trend is directed towards
millennials, because their lives revolve around screens the most. Modern
film-making has allowed the blending of actions on the web and reactions to it
for us to simultaneously consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These films have much smaller budgets. The return on investment can be immense.
&lt;em&gt;Searching&lt;/em&gt; made $75 million against a budget of $1 million, and &lt;em&gt;Unfriended&lt;/em&gt;
made 64 times its budget. But is there more to this subgenre than meets the eye?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, one can see that this style expresses a lot by saying little.
Social media tells us about habits, likes and desires not just of the user but
also of people engaging with said user. It is the rapidity with which the story
gets out that makes screen thrillers this gripping. When people are online and
texting each other, the messages, the time taken to reply, or the choice to not
reply at all, everything leads to some assumptions in both the audience and the
characters. This technique plays upon our conditioning to believe that tiny
things are indicators of something large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to hide porn from your parents, you naturally put it in some folder
in an extreme corner of the depths of your desktop. And when your parents find
out they are shocked and upset. The way those reactions get captured in a screen
thriller is unparalleled. The screen need not resort to edits or cut-aways to
show the reaction; it is right there. The actor reacts at the same time as the
audience does, they are as much the spectator as we are. The lesser reliance on
cut-aways directly takes the audience on the protagonist’s journey. While not
exclusive to the genre, Screen Life films surely help bring out the often
shocking difference that exists between our lives and our personas, in real life
and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These films come attached with a sense of claustrophobia, to say the least. The
screen is crowded with pop-ups, the user keeps switching between tabs and
windows. This adds to not only the pace of the film but also the paranoia of the
viewer. Every step of the way, there lurks a  fear, it is like you are always
waiting for the next development. You are excited for what comes next, no matter
how deeply personal or confidential it might be for the victim. Not that that is
wrong; it is a story, after all. But it does explain something about the human
desire to voyeur over others’ lives; both the good and the bad. As David
Fincher, the director of &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; says, “People are perverts.” They
want to know the truth, but the kicker is that it will be ugly. Nevertheless,
they will love it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <link href="/The-Lens-of-Pop-Culture" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Lived Experience Through The Lens of Pop Culture" />
      <published>2019-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2019-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/The-Lens-of-Pop-Culture</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/The-Lens-of-Pop-Culture">&lt;p&gt;Pop culture was never meant to be therapeutic for the conscience. It was merely
an escape from reality, a make-believe world where you could imagine yourself as
Clint Eastwood on a horse, or as Sylvester Stallone being one hell of a southpaw
boxer. Or, it could have been you taking acid during a Jimi Hendrix concert, or
raging with the grunge bands of the 90’s. It was only in the 2000’s, the
millennial age, when mainstream pop culture became a place for the reclamation
of maligned narratives. Finally, a space on the global stage for those with
little social capital. Be it non-cisgender people, African-Americans, Latinos or
people with clinical depression; the millennial age did more than take note of
these problems, it made sure that they were heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to strip the periods before that of credit for their art. Movies
like &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Platoon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Now&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Deer Hunter&lt;/em&gt; surely
gave an insight into the prevailing anti-war sentiment in the USA and the
protests by soldiers’ families. These movies could, however, very well be termed
‘Oscar bait’, and they got swept away in the same instead of provoking perhaps
finer, more nuanced details of, say, military life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a movie like &lt;em&gt;Driving Miss Daisy&lt;/em&gt;, for example. It won the Best Picture
Oscar in 1980, but its premise might make one skeptical about the award. Apart
from the hailing of a  ‘white saviour’, the film also promoted stereotypes about
Afro-Americans; illiterate, not self dependent, helpless people who don’t know
what to do in the face of problems. They’re undermined in their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between that time and today, however, is that our generation
won’t shy away from criticising such films. The films of yore too are
scrutinised under the modern lens of how an ideal world must be; a
post-postmodern critique, if you will. That’s how the image of &lt;em&gt;James Bond&lt;/em&gt; has
evolved. There is no denying that people did not take to a one-dimensional
womanizer spy with cheeky sensibilities and a way to escape every situation
effortlessly. They wanted someone more vulnerable and mortal, and possibly not a
man, which is evident in the recent wave of Bond movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, take a look at the movies and shows of today. &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; was a pivotal
movie that took shots at liberals for ‘acting black’, thinking that that would
solve racism. A less-talked-about but incredibly influential show was the Donald
Glover show &lt;em&gt;Atlanta&lt;/em&gt;, that was hailed by many Atlanta natives as a true
portrayal of life and culture in the city. The show humanised Afro-Americans.
This trend extends to a lot of shows, like &lt;em&gt;Orange Is The New Black&lt;/em&gt;, that
eventually went beyond the lead character and ended up becoming one of the most
inclusive shows in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainstream music has also changed drastically over the past two decades. Hip-hop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a genre often criticised for the use of homophobic slurs as a metric for
masculinity - has now included artists like Tyler, The Creator, and more
recently, Lil Nas X who thought it was safe enough to reveal their sexualities
and talk about their experiences through their music. Notably, Tyler was accused
of using one such slur. Musicians such as St Vincent and Troye Sivan have been
much more open about the same throughout their discography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious hip-hop has also gained popularity, with the advent of artists like
Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West, who wrap messages and lived experiences in ear
candy. Even pop stars like Beyonce and Lady Gaga have been using their global
influence to further discussions that several years ago would have been
considered too taboo to even be talked about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does this increasing demand for inclusivity tell us? We, the
millennials, want our screens to show us something that evokes not merely
sympathy but also empathy. We want to see lived experiences. We do not want
tokenistic gestures of inclusivity, but full-blooded accounts of stories about
people that are not necessarily us. The idea that racism is over simply because
a privileged character learns about the struggles of the ostracised minority,
has been running for all of Hollywood’s existence; Hollywood’s systemic Oscar
bait and guaranteed cash churning mechanism. Authentic stories, like real life,
are possibly boring to them. They also forget the one rule of moviemaking: do
not underestimate the audience. The same goes for music: concept albums exist to
tell a story that’s beyond our imagination. Millennials, especially those who
are part of the minority have become fed up of the fact that they can not see
any entertainment that resembles them. They expect human depictions of what it
means to belong to their race, religion, caste or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might even argue that the severance of human connection has left us seeking
something &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in our cinema. The millennial is looking for relatability and
human fallibility more than he is looking for fantasy. The craving to feel is
seen in how much readership emo Tumblr experiences achieve or in how much shows
like BoJack Horseman shine. BoJack Horseman is highly acclaimed primarily
because it really touches a nerve, in millennials, in the domain of mental
health. It lets its viewers comprehend the consequences of such actions that
already might have happened to them. Besides, the idea then also becomes about
combining reality and fantasy, brutality and comedy, to make more high-end
surreal art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is definitely the tough question that all of this poses: do we really need
more and more art to get us to empathise with something? Isn’t once enough? To
be honest, we are all guilty of it, including this writer here. It becomes a
global statement, that our inaction, or our perception is part of the problem,
if not the actual problem. But it has been done before, with resounding success.
During the #BlackLivesMatter movement in 2015, Kendrick Lamar released his hit
song &lt;em&gt;Alright&lt;/em&gt;. The refrain “We gon’ be alright” became the cry of the rally for
some time and unified the protestors. We do not need conscious art to feel good
about ourselves because we have seen/heard it; we need it to make us better
people, if at all we really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that inclusion and adequate representation in media has taken a
much higher priority today as compared to earlier times. A UCLA study on
diversity in Hollywood states that people of colour have quadrupled their share
of broadcast television from 5.1% in 2011-12 to 21.5% in 2017-18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials are better educated as compared to previous generations, with 39% of
people having a bachelor’s degree or higher; to compare, at the same age, the
same statistic was 29% for Gen X, around 25% for baby boomers, and 15% for the
Silent Generation. Higher education is becoming accessible to people of various
cultures. The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey talks about how millennials only
like firms that abide by their values, and any non-adherence to consumer values
on their part will make them or break them. People are more receptive to
personal and social problems, and while there are a myriad of surveys pointing
to how millennials are becoming less empathetic, one can not deny that it is the
millennials who are shaping narratives about intersectionality, privilege, class
and race amongst other things. Call it political correctness or call it
sensitivity, it has arguably bettered the debate. It is this nuance that is
slowly but surely influencing content around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quintessential to this is the scenario of Indian stand-up comedy. After the
calling out of the prevalence of sexual harassment in what was perceived as a
circle that was &lt;em&gt;woke just for show&lt;/em&gt;, female comedians have been earning what’s
due to them. Their jokes are a lot more oriented towards the female experience,
quite naturally, whilst their other observations are arguably spot on. In
another example, TVF’s &lt;em&gt;Kota Factory&lt;/em&gt; created ripples across the student
community in India for its bleak but true depiction of the city. Engineering
students possibly shed tears at the time the show was released because they saw
their life reflected in it. Millennials are both creating and consuming bold
content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studios understand the importance of discourse for long-term retention of the
millennial as a consumer. This is evident in the shifts in strategy by platforms
such as Netflix towards creating content that is politically or socially
charged. These shifts in strategy betray how they see their consumers; as a
generation that wants to confront socio-politico realities head on. As a
generation that is so desperate to connect to the characters on screen, to view
life through the lens of cinema as a way of trying to make sense of our own
troubles and our trauma. We seek a lot fewer heroes and a lot more flawed humans
in our cinema.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The good news is that inclusion and adequate representation in media has taken a much higher priority today as compared to earlier times. A UCLA study on diversity in Hollywood states that people of colour have quadrupled their share of broadcast television from 5.1% in 2011-12 to 21.5% in 2017-18. Millennials are better educated as compared to previous generations, with 39% of people having a bachelor’s degree or higher; to compare, at the same age, the same statistic was 29% for Gen X, around 25% for baby boomers, and 15% for the Silent Generation. Higher education is becoming accessible to people of various cultures. The Deloitte Global Millennial Survey talks about how millennials only like firms that abide by their values, and any non-adherence to consumer values on their part will make them or break them. People are more receptive to personal and social problems, and while there are a myriad of surveys pointing to how millennials are becoming less empathetic, one can not deny that it is the millennials who are shaping narratives about intersectionality, privilege, class and race amongst other things. Call it political correctness or call it sensitivity, it has arguably bettered the debate. It is this nuance that is slowly but surely influencing content around us.   Quintessential to this is the scenario of Indian stand-up comedy. After the calling out of the prevalence of sexual harassment in what was perceived as a circle that was woke just for show, female comedians have been earning what’s due to them. Their jokes are a lot more oriented towards the female experience, quite naturally, whilst their other observations are arguably spot on. In another example, TVF’s Kota Factory created ripples across the student community in India for its bleak but true depiction of the city. Engineering students possibly shed tears at the time the show was released because they saw their life reflected in it. Millennials are both creating and consuming bold content. Studios understand the importance of discourse for long-term retention of the millennial as a consumer. This is evident in the shifts in strategy by platforms such as Netflix towards creating content that is politically or socially charged. These shifts in strategy betray how they see their consumers; as a generation that wants to confront socio-politico realities head on. As a generation that is so desperate to connect to the characters on screen, to view life through the lens of cinema as a way of trying to make sense of our own troubles and our trauma. We seek a lot fewer heroes and a lot more flawed humans in our cinema.</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/Martin-Scorsese-and-The-American-Dream">&lt;p&gt;(Spoilers ahead for &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was looking at reviews of &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, a film
that I love a lot. Upon noticing a lot of negative comments I decided to rewatch
it and watching it reminded me of why I loved that film so much; not because of
how the film manages to spill excess into every scene, but because of how in the
midst of it all, a message lies hidden. The same message that Martin Scorsese
has always tried to illustrate throughout his filmography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scorsese loves to show the downfall of the Man in the high castle. Be it
&lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Raging Bull&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Aviator&lt;/em&gt;, and this 3-hour debauchery act
that I’ll be focusing on primarily, Scorsese focuses quite a lot on male ego.
What ties his stories together is how his characters’ life choices are
influenced by their dreamland. In other words, the protagonists in all of his
movies and shows wanted to live the &lt;em&gt;American Dream&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has always been seen as a land of opportunity. Throughout the history of
the USA, one can observe immigrants from various European countries finding a
place in this glorious nation to make a living. It continues even today, as seen
in students coming from all over the world to America to study or in Silicon
Valley, where a sizeable percentage of the workforce is of quasi-American
heritage, that too only by a generation or so. The immigrants’ aim to get a
coveted degree, a top job at a quant firm or under a tech mogul, or to kickstart
their venture into a high-life which they always wanted. Microsoft is headed by
an Indian today, Facebook was founded by multiple Jewish-Americans with other
mixed heritages, and these are just the biggest examples in a vast sea of such
cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: America hasn’t necessarily been kind to a lot of outsiders.
The cases in the limelight were stories of success that create a narrative that
you could be anyone, you could be dirt poor, but you’ll always find a way to
make something out of the land of the brave and the free. But in reality, one’s
likelihood to succeed is rigged by factors such as race and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20th century, there was mass immigration of Italians to America.
Many of them were very poor and lived in neighbourhoods characterised by
poverty. Gradually, they grew out of it but, initially, life was rather too
hard. They were involved in low-paying blue-collar jobs, had difficulty
adjusting to their surroundings as they faced issues like the inability to speak
English and considerable discrimination during World War II by the US
government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of such adversity, the definition of the American Dream had become
slightly skewed. It became an end in itself and the means to attain it was left
open to a fair extent. This is where my example of Italian-Americans comes in
(I’m well aware that this could be advancing a stereotypical narrative about
them which is not my intention, but nonetheless, it surely is a sociological
factor). In Italy, the institution of family was very important, to the extent
that they would do anything to protect and advance the interests of their own
kind. Italian-Americans organized themselves in places like New York, and
created communities around them where they had control over the socio-economic
conditions of their people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular example of Italian-Americans is pertinent because of Scorsese’s
focus on it. &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt; is a movie about how Italian gangsters in New York
made their profession look cool and aspirational around their neighbourhood;
their display of power enticed anybody who wanted to make the American Dream a
reality. The idea of a family also becomes important here; Henry Hill had said
that being an Italian mobster was better than being the President of the United
States of America because of how relaxed these mobsters are. They have shady but
steady sources of income, and no one to trouble them. The reason I can see
behind this is that the Italian mobster feels no responsibility towards others.
With this, the idea of the American Dream shifted from making use of the
opportunity to succeed in the land of the American Dream without responsibility
towards anyone or anything at all, at least for those who feel the need to
resort to illegitimate means, even if in limited quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; exemplifies that philosophy to perfection. Leading a
normal life is a frustrating ordeal for Jordan Belfort. It all begins with one
morally ambiguous choice. Jordan Belfort started selling stocks of companies
that were not financially sound enough to get themselves listed on a legitimate
stock exchange. He overlooked the fact that consumers might be adversely
affected by such a deal with the misguided assurance that every company makes
profits in the long run! Belfort has sex with everyone but his wife. She won’t
find out, problem sorted! &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt; advances its story in the same vein;
let’s bribe the cops, so everyone is happy. People get what they want, if only
they put in the ‘effort’ to acquire it. So, everything could be hacked. But all
of it becomes a problem when you want more, or when you find the need to sustain
that lifestyle. You get sucked in, and you can’t find a way out. Stockbroking
was a highly focused job that requires one to remain calm at all times.
Substance usage provided that enhanced ability. Promiscuous sex provided the
relief after. Home life provided the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, this conception of the American Dream was most
magnified when money-crazed kids read a &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; piece that was actually critical
of Jordan Belfort and decided to join his firm, Stratton Oakmont. Drugs, women,
capital, a need for the high life. It was everything that an average American
male needed; a break from the monotony of merely existing and working an
unexciting job to feel larger than life. The middle-class could now profit off
of the impulsiveness of the 1%, which was what Leonardo DiCaprio’s character
initially set out to do. In part, this obsession can be attributed to the huge
amounts of investment flowing through the economy, and mass media like the
Michael Douglas-starrer &lt;em&gt;Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; glorifying the “greed is good” image. With
corporate raiders gaining infamy on the scene, the market being generally
bullish, and huge leveraged buyouts being made (case in point being RJR
Nabisco), Wall Street was a party. What is more interesting is that you could be
a college dropout, an illiterate beggar, and Wall Street will still let you make
your own fortune. That was where the appeal lay; selling is an art that can be
learned irrespective of where you are in life. It primarily became a game of
convincing American citizens that they wanted to shift their capital elsewhere,
without holding any responsibility for their investments in the future. And why
not this game? It was a comparatively easy and a quick way to make money. “Sell
me a pen” became quotable as a line later on, because it was an exhibition of
the idea that doing this much was enough to signify one’s potential for success,
the main determinant of which was wealth. The product was not necessarily the
seller’s own, he/she was just a middleman who won a fat commission on each sale.
No responsibility, no accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not just have this art of selling people things they didn’t want. What
Jordan Belfort was most successful at was selling the perfect life to his
employees. In the scene where he makes the motivational speech before the Steve
Madden IPO, he draws a contrast between the women that men desire (“with big
voluptuous tits”), and the women that are “disgusting wildebeests with three
days of razor stubble”. That was his best sale ever, not the penny stocks that
were essentially scams. What Scorsese really wanted to show here was how toxic
masculinity began to shape the American Dream, mainly by saying that money can
buy everything, including your happiness. One may argue that Belfort knew that
it was all a crime, so he could have backed out by striking a deal with the FBI
when they offered him a back door. But no, he felt too attached to this baby of
his; this company that he had started from scratch after a disastrous stock
market crash had left him unemployed. A parallel to this could be how attached
&lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad’s&lt;/em&gt; Walter White felt for his Baby Blue - his meth empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt; contains streaks of this American Dream. The opening lines of
Jack Nicholson’s crazed, senile Irish gangster character says that he wants his
environment to be a product of him, and not the other way round. He criticises
the Afro-American community, calling them the N-word, saying that they were
where they were because they could never “take it”. Nobody would give it to
them. This idea of carving out your own environment to survive, no matter how
illegitimate, defined the American Dream as presented in Scorsese’s films. It is
safe to say that as the son of Americans with Italian heritage himself, he has
seen the dream suck people into an abyss. This is not to say he doesn’t thank
America for being so kind to him; &lt;em&gt;Gangs of New York&lt;/em&gt; was a celebration of that.
However, the thought of taking matters into one’s own hands became such an
obsession for Americans that it eventually led to the downfall of prominent,
wealthy people. They may have started from the bottom, but they definitely
forgot their roots because that was always their intention. No one wants to
remember painful beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin Scorsese has always evoked extreme reactions from his viewers. The
surface viewer might just think that &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; was a 3-hour
grossed-out porno-comedy without any message. That person misses a lot of the
important shots that convey a deeper meaning, like that of the federal agent
tasked with bringing Belfort to justice or shots of dull-faced middle-class
people in a metro train. According to the film, the federal agent wanted to be a
broker sometime in the past. And despite nailing such a huge arrest, he felt
empty inside. He could never live the life Belfort did, even when he had the
choice to. All it remained for him was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
