In 2019, he took another attempt at revising that same theme with &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;. It feels like a full-circle moment when I was asked to write on it because the first thing that I thought of when I watched this 3-hour epic was that this was Scorsese looking back introspectively on his own career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I want to note that* The Irishman* has very little similarity to &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt;, or The &lt;em&gt;Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Mean Streets&lt;/em&gt;, apart from style. The first shot of the movie shows a heavily made-up Robert De Niro, playing an old, wheelchair-ridden Frank Sheeran, narrating his story in flashback-style. If I had known better, this was indication enough that &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; is not going to be the type of borderline glorification that Martin Scorsese has been accused of throughout his career. His movies generally start with the energy of youth - Jordan Belfort’s infectious but immature energy to be a bull, Henry Hill with an iconic line about how he always wanted to be a gangster or even the excitement of running casinos mixed with all the sins you can think of in &lt;em&gt;Casino&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; progresses with showing how Frank Sheeran, an American of Irish descent, started off as a meat truck driver after leaving army service, a possibly traumatic experience where he may have killed unarmed Germans who were willing to surrender, just as a revenge statement. He shows no qualms in joining the Bufalino crime family and doing questionable things for money and, hence, a more stable family life. He would do as he was told, no questions asked. Loyalty took first place above all other ambitions. The violence in the movie was subtle, there was nothing flashy about the editing of the movie in terms of it making the movie more frenetic, and everyone who was killed in the movie was just done off without a lot of hullabaloos, unlike Scorsese’s other films. Mind you,* The Irishman* has lots of killings. The difference was that most of them were hardly shown visually, but merely explained. In stark contrast, &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt; has an entire montage showing how wiseguys Tommy, Jimmy and Henry eliminated people that could have troubled them. In &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;, every person who died before Sheeran was accompanied by a text infographic showing their name, date of death and cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It speaks volumes about what Scorsese wants to achieve through the movie. Is it to make the mob life more interesting, and show what attracts people to that side of life? If that was the case, there would really be nothing separating &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Casino&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Mean Streets&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; has more in common with &lt;em&gt;Raging Bull&lt;/em&gt; than any of his other films. &lt;em&gt;Raging Bull&lt;/em&gt; starts very similarly - after a celebrated, but incredibly rough boxing career marred by relationship issues, anger, abuse, a prison sentence, and a run with the Mafia, Jake LaMotta becomes a stand-up comedian. He looks at himself in the mirror, and monologues about the point of his life. He’s become much fatter compared to his boxer days and looks withered out. Scorsese may often be accused of having extremely stock female characters that aren’t well fleshed out. However, to his credit, he doesn’t spare anything in ripping the character of his male leads to shreds, to the extent that they may be unlikeable. At the same time, the world that they live in draws you, and you can’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; is not that world. The second hour of the movie focuses on Sheeran’s relationship with Jimmy Hoffa, the leader of the Teamsters Union of workers, and thereby a hugely-respected man. All of the problematic things Hoffa does is for the betterment of his workers. Otherwise, he has a joyful code of conduct in life. He loves his family and turns out to be a better father figure to Sheeran’s younger daughter, Peggy, than Sheeran himself. This hour of the movie is extremely wholesome - Sheeran discovers that you can form personal, endearing relationships with the people you work for. For him, that person was Hoffa. This friendship sounds hardly like any of the partnerships that were present in Scorsese’s filmography. They were based on a code of brotherhood: friendly enough that neither would screw the other over, but professional enough that each knows his boundaries. Sheeran helped Hoffa build his American Dream, where the workers feel empowered and have maximum bargaining power. It wouldn’t take Hoffa one day to shut down operations across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoffa was jailed for jury tampering in 1963 by the Kennedy administration. According to the movie, he wanted to come back to power in the Union. His replacement, Frank Fitzsimmons, was handing out interest-free loans to the Bufalino family. Hoffa was barred by Nixon from interacting with any labour organisation in any capacity. He also had a prison spat with Anthony Provenzano, former vice-president of the Union and New Jersey mob leader. The Mafia was wary of Hoffa’s rise to power, which may have disrupted their arrangements with the Union. Soon enough, Russell Bufalino called for his head, and ordered Frank Sheeran to do it, at least, according to the movie’s stance: nobody can actually confirm who was involved in Hoffa’s disappearance. The book written by Charles Brandt is vocal about Sheeran’s direct involvement, and hence, the movie as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next 30 minutes are spent in patience, waiting up to the moment where Sheeran shoots Hoffa. The 30 minutes after are spent in Sheeran trying to process the emotion of regret, but possibly failing, or being unable to move on. He goes to confession, brags about Jimmy Hoffa to his hospice care with pride as if he were a rockstar in his time, all the while trying to grapple with what he had truly done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One look at a summary of the movie tells you that it plays about the classic elements of a standard mob movie very subtly. The idea that you could bend your moral code just a little each day so that you could achieve your ideal of the American Dream, got tested with each questionable act, or each emotion that Sheeran was unable to process. The code of loyalty, brotherhood and business, that so tightly binds mobs in gangster movies was broken down in the most emotional way possible. What Scorsese may have done before is show downfall in terms of a sentence served, a physical manifestation of Icarus flying too close to the sun. Nobody was shown to be eaten from the insides, unlike Frank Sheeran here. It wasn’t the prison sentence he served later that was his penance; it was the fact that he had to live with being unable to truly feel for Hoffa, despite wanting to so badly because he loved him. One may argue that the American Dream doesn’t care about how you feel: in a race to consume everything by growing to be the best version of yourself financially, you forget about your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, mob movies are tied by familial bonds, which become another foundation for the American Dream as defined by the mafioso, or the genre of movies. Your actions are justified to a fair extent as long as you’re extending the benefits to your family and giving them a happy life. &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt; indulged in that idea for the longest time. In &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;, it hardly mattered. Peggy, Sheeran’s youngest daughter, never looked at him as a father. For all the money and stature that he may have earned, he could never gain the trust of someone who arguably mattered more. What is worse was that Sheeran never truly found out why his daughter was so quiet around him. He never figured out it was a resentment of the violence he perpetrated or the fact that his name was in the papers for all the wrong reasons. He didn’t spend too much time with her either. His being around for her was restricted to financial concern and physical protection, or so says the movie. And &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; then elaborates on why that in itself is so preposterous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the movie, rather fittingly, this piece feels like an extended epilogue to the first article I wrote for The Pangean. I had no idea &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; would be this entire flip from what old man Marty had done before. I remember laughing so much when I first saw &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas. *I rewatch *The Departed *every time I’m free, *Hugo&lt;/em&gt; was nice too and &lt;em&gt;The Wolf of Wall Street&lt;/em&gt; is also a riot with every viewing. &lt;em&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/em&gt; is jarring and &lt;em&gt;Raging Bull&lt;/em&gt; is wondrous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then who’s cutting these onions? &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; is easily one of the best movies of last year (second-best in this author’s humble opinion) because it does exactly what no one expected: get you teary-eyed for the life of nonagenarian Irish mobster, based on a story that, while unconfirmed, is most likely true, and was heralded by a boomer that has changed the face of cinema as we have known it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Pranav Manie</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">My first article for The Pangean was on how Martin Scorsese felt about the ‘American Dream’ and expressed the same through the medium of his movies.

Most of us do not really associate pole dancing with sports. It reminds us of strip clubs and excessively raunchy moves in skimpy clothing. The truth, however, is that the very sexualised act of dancing on a pole requires immense muscle strength and is inherently very artistic: two things that characterise many mainstream sports including gymnastics and diving. Nevertheless, for the longest time, pole dancing in the Western world has been performed only by strippers and none of them were very proud of their work. The stigma surrounding sex work kept the hidden potential of pole dancing under covers for a very long time. But the last two decades has seen some extreme transition in terms of how pole dancing is perceived and practiced; and today, it dreams to be a part of the Olympic programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early 2000s turned people’s heads, as pole dancing began its roller coaster ride to mainstream popularity as a fitness routine. After all, pole dancing undeniably involves intense upper body strength. Many also argue that pole dancing is a form of art. It involves expressing and finding oneself, which is basically what art is for. Besides, who can deny that pole dancing is extremely aesthetically pleasing. More recently, pole dancing has also started on its journey as a move of female empowerment. The first time I came across something like this was when I watched one of my favourite youtubers Devin of the channel Ladylike share her sexual assault story. Her rape had left her in a dark place and she was desperately trying to get back her confidence, and pole dancing helped her find her way out. She talked about S Factor, a pole dancing academy aimed at empowering women and encouraging them to be sexy for themselves rather than someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S Factor is the brainchild of Sheila Kelley who has been featured in various talk shows including that of Oprah Winfrey. She has also been a speaker at TEDx American Riviera. In her roughly 20 minute long talk titled ‘Lets Get Naked’ she hits on various feminist issues like female objectification and talks about the sexual reclamation of the female body. Kelley was only a young actress when she ended paying a strip club an unwanted visit, and the experience made her fall in love with the art of pole dancing. She went on to write and produce a film where she played a stripper called “Dancing at the Blue Iguana”. She learnt the art of pole dancing and as she reiterates throughout the talk, found herself during the process. She realised that pole dancing is not just about stripping for men, it is a lot more than that. By the end of it all, she knew she had to share her revelation and the art with women across the world. In no time, she gained a massive fan following among women across borders. Her conviction that finding one’s sensual identity had a major positive psychological impact led her to start her own pole dancing company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pole dancing continued on its ambitious path to get rid of the stigma associated with it, #NotAStripper started trending on Twitter. However, it is difficult to claim that it was well received. Twitterati attacked pole dancers, claiming that their routines were not even half as pleasing as those performed by strippers or that their story was not as important as the multitude of other issues that the modern woman faces. Besides the fact that these people clearly did not get the memo that pole dancers were not really indulging in the art to please others, they also failed to recognise that the aim was to dissociate the art or sport of pole dancing from the stigma associated with stripping. However, many also claimed that the hashtag was a blatant proof of whorephobia that it is deep rooted in the belief that sex work is not really ‘work’. Very soon, stripper and activist Elle Stanger created the #YesAStripper in response. She was once quoted saying “…#NotAStripper and I am like, OK, why is that important? Why do you feel the need to differentiate?” Her hashtag had a significantly larger number of tags than the former and it seemed like a great social media win within a very short span of time. Stanger has also repeatedly said that it was necessary in order to let recreational pole dancers respect and embrace their professions at the fullest. While all these were going on, many even argued that modern pole dancing is the brainchild of strippers and thus, #NotAStripper was borderline disrespectful. However, it seems that pole dance has much older roots than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese Pole is an ancient form of acrobatics born during the Qin and Han dynasties of China between 221 BC and 230 AD. While one can easily spot several similarities between Chinese Pole and Pole Dance, there are some very important divergences. The pole used in the former is much taller, often extending upto 30 feet. The length gave it a necessary wobble during the acrobatic performances. Besides, pole dancing adds dancing, calisthenics and gymnastics to make it more erotic or aesthetically pleasing, depending on the audience and requirement. Another form of exercise bearing close resemblance to the modern day pole dance is Mallakhamba, an ancient Indian sport. This sport involves gymnasts performing aerial yoga postures on a pole or a vertical rope. However, it is undeniable that modern day pole dance is very different from these ancient forms of ‘sport’ and in fact, was born in the strip clubs. Clearly, Chinese Pole and Mallakhamba were performed as sports in the past, in stark contrast to the conventional pole dancing in gentlemen’s clubs. However, some pole dancers have actually practiced the art as a sport for a while now and envision a future where pole dancing is a regular at the Olympics. Various figures across the world have advocated for this cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years many have backed the inclusion of various sports, which were fast-tracking their way to their main-stream acceptance as a legitimate sport, in the Olympics. The non-existent formal and popular definition of the term ‘sport’ makes it easy to accept or deny the status to various activities by the general public. Case in point, cheerleading. Often appreciated for the very enthusiastic and artistic moves alongside the incredibly difficult jumps and gymnastics, cheerleading is often dismissed easily in sports discussions. Many consider sports to be an activity that is inherently competitive in nature and follows certain rules. Cheerleading, however, is popularly seen as an activity solely meant to entertain the crowd during various sporting events. Many also believe that there is no proper mechanism by which cheerleading competitions can be judged. Proponents of the debate argue that cheerleading requires at least, if not more, as much effort, practice and dedication as mainstream gymnastics. Besides, they claim that the problems associated with judging cheerleading tournaments are encountered in sports like figure skating, synchronised swimming and gymnastics too and thus, the argument is, in the mildest terms, frail. However, after the immense success of having breakdancing in the 2018 Youth Olympics, ‘Breaking’ was added to the program of the 2024 Games to be held at Paris. This came in response to the IOC’s aim to make the Olympics “more urban” and “more artistic”. Climbing, skateboarding and surfing were also added to the programme after a unanimous vote by the IOC’s session in Lausanne, Switzerland on June 25, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various sports federations and commissions have come up with varying definitions of the term  ‘sports’. The Global Association of International Sports Federation’s definition of a sport has many requirements. Besides the fact that the proposed ‘sport’ must have an element of competition and should not rely on any element of luck, it should also not pose any risks to the health or safety of the participants. In addition, the equipment used cannot be provided by a single supplier. Going by this definition and the fact that the IOC is eager to revolutionise the Games to be more “artistic” and “urban”, I see no reason why the process of inclusion of pole dancing in the Olympics is being delayed. This ‘process’ involves various steps, many of which have already been achieved by the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katie Coates, the woman behind the International Pole Sports Federation (IPSF) and pole dancing’s 11 year struggle to be recognised as a professional sport, always dreamt of seeing pole dancing in the Olympics. In 2006, Coates conducted a survey to review the public’s opinion on pole dancing as a sport and over 10,000 people voted in the favour of it being included in the Olympics. In 2008, she collaborated with Tim Trautman and started working on the IPSF and coined the term ‘pole sports’. Soon, various federations across the world cropped up and competitive pole sports started gaining attention. However, this was not easy especially for Coates. Abuses were hurled at her as many didn’t appreciate her efforts to reinvent pole dancing as a serious sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that the art of pole dancing is dominated by women, thanks to its exploitative history. In fact, a startling majority of pole sports federations across the world are run by women. Over the years, pole dancing has been harshly criticised as an antithesis to movements of female empowerment. Ariel Levy’s book* Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture* is one such literature. In the book she writes, “spinning greasily around a pole… is more of a parody of female sexual power than an expression of it. How is resurrecting every stereotype of female sexuality that feminism endeavoured to banish for good for women?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many women who actually practice pole dancing vehemently criticise this view. Third wave feminists argue that women should have control over their lives and their decisions. The ability to choose a career path, manner of expression, dressing and so on is integral to the feminist movement. Therefore, the choice to be a pole dancer and or or a stripper is empowering as long as the woman concerned retains control over her decisions. However, the stigma against pole dancing perpetuates even among the most liberal-minded of people. An incident that bears testimony to the same took place back in September, 2016. An event aimed at ending violence against women and the popular culture of victim blaming called the “Take Back the Night” march was going to be organised, and London Abused Women’s Centre (LAWC) was due to participate in the same. However, on finding out that a pole fitness studio would be in attendance, they immediately withdrew their participation. The programme manager for LAWC was quoted saying, “we will not solve women’s oppression by dancing on a pole”. In countries like China, Russia and several South and Central American countries, however, pole dance never existed in the heavily sexualised form that people in other countries popularly know of today. In fact, in Mexico, pole sports is funded alongside other Olympic sports. This includes provisions for sports science testing and youth programmes. Although pole sports found it easy to establish itself as a serious sport in these countries, the stigma of sex work continues to haunt athletes in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major set back came in 2011 when it came to light that an estimated 95% of all Pole Sports athletes were women, something that the IOC did not appreciate. However, this did little to discourage Coates and 2012 witnessed the inaugural edition of the World Pole Sports Championship with the humble participation count of 38 women and 5 men. By the following year, the youth category was introduced and the first year saw the participation of only 7 athletes. As the athletes continued to fight to establish pole sports as a serious sport, the need for a rulebook became very apparent. Very soon a rulebook was devised that lists down the compulsory moves and categories of skills required for ranking each routine. Initially the book comprised only 20 moves but by 2018, it was already 170 pages long. New techniques are invented and added every year. After hiccuping its way through the years, 2017 brought in great news for pole sports enthusiasts. The male and novice categories were introduced in the World Pole Sports Championship which increased male participation by 70% and an 80% increase in participation in the youth category was observed. A total of a staggering 229 athletes from 36 countries across the globe competed in the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in spite of all this, Katie Coates’ goal of making pole sports an Olympic event remained unfulfilled. She reached her first milestone in the direction of the same in 2017 when GAISF announced its recognition of pole dancing as a professional sport. Coates was quoted saying, “In the early 2000’s people started doing it as fitness routine and taking away the sex stigma, so no high heels and making it accessible for average people. Pole dancing is not like everyone thinks it is, you need to actually watch it to understand.” The IPSF continues to emphasise that pole sports is all about “athleticism and technical merit” and that it is in line with “other Olympic standard sports such as gymnastics, diving and ice skating.” They argue that even though the act of pole dancing is popularly associated with strip clubs, a performance does not have to contain an erotic element. By extension, the IPSF deems pole sports appropriate for all ages and audiences and thus, runs competitions for athletes between the ages of 10 and 65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three basic criteria that a particular sport needs to meet in order for it to be eligible for Olympic consideration. Firstly, it needs to be signed to the World Anti-Doping Agency. It also must be a full member of GAISF and finally, it must have at least 50 national federations. Pole sports currently fulfills only the first criteria. In February, 2020, GAISF awarded Observer Status for a further 2 years to pole sports. However, there is still a long way to go before we probably actually see pole sports in the Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that pole dancing has come a long way from its days of being a profession that required women to strip for men in exchange for money while society continued to look down upon them to a sport that is fast gaining attention and support to be featured in the Olympics. A little more than two decades ago pole dancers were afraid of even acknowledging their profession in fear of being seen as ‘too easy’ and harassed. Today, women are using the art of pole dancing for their sensual awakening and learning how to be sexy for themselves. A large number of people across the world have incorporated pole dancing into their fitness routines. Many others, irrespective of their gender and age, are embracing pole dancing as a form of expression and sport. Presently, it is fast turning into a symbol of feminism much the same way the mini skirt has become the symbol of women’s liberation over the years. However, whether or not pole dancing will be able to make space for itself in the Olympics is a question only time can answer. For now, that continues to be the goal that athletes have in mind as they fight for recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oindrila Ghosh</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Let’s be real, the title sounds interesting to you because at first glance it seems to be an oxymoron.

The year marked the death of more than 17,000 children under the age of five, of which two-thirds were suffering from easily preventable communicable diseases. 20% of the poorest households in the country also slipped Below Poverty Line due to hefty payments on healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, massive reforms were undertaken by the winning party, Thai Rak Thai, which led to the introduction of Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS). The UCS, which spread to all provinces the following year, provides outpatient, inpatient and emergency care, which is available to all according to need. Within a decade, the program covered 48 million citizens or 98% of the Thais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of their achievement must not be understated. Even today, developed, high-income countries such as the US struggle with schemes like universal health insurance coverage. But Thailand, a developing country, with its meagre per capita income of $1900 (in 2001, at the time of the initiation of this policy) achieved astounding improvement in access and quality of healthcare without putting too much pressure on the fiscal vaults. So, how did Thailand achieve the near-impossible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history-of-thailands-uhc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Thailand’s UHC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning three decades ago, Thailand’s health care policy first covered the poor, then the near-poor, the formal sector employees, and finally the children and the elderly, through various publicly funded and contributory schemes until it reached 71% of the entire population in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, Thailand launched its ‘first medical care programme.’ The starting population coverage was 30%, but the service coverage, although comprehensive, was not deep. It then, gradually, covered the near-poor in 1985, based on a voluntary, publicly subsidised healthcare scheme. From 1982 to 1986, despite the economic crisis, the government decided to freeze all capital investment in the urban hospitals and shifted the limited resources to build rural district hospitals and health centres with extensive training of community-level health professionals and rural doctors. This resulted in the rapid, nationwide expansion of rural health services and broadened access to 15 essential health services at the community level. Around one million village health volunteers were recruited and trained to assist health personnel in providing basic healthcare and health education to their communities. The volunteers helped distribute essential drugs and get children vaccinated; they also built sanitary latrines and clean-water reservoirs and implemented nutrition programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formal sector employees were covered by the contributory Social Security Health Insurance in 1992. Across developing countries, assurance of the quality of healthcare continues to be the most persistent challenge of government-funded schemes. But programs initiated in the 1970’s helped Thailand invest heavily in infrastructure, build hospitals and clinics and train medical personnel to support universal coverage. After the implementation of the Universal Coverage Scheme, this long-term investment in the sector finally paid off as relationships between doctors and patients transformed completely. Before, patients paid a fee to their doctors when they visited the hospital. After 2001, the government paid hospitals, including salaries for staff, and financially incentivised medical professionals to serve unpopular rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s health scheme is primarily funded by general income tax and costs only $80 billion annually (2011). The system has successfully reduced infant mortality, decreased workers’ sick days and lightened families’ financial burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;policy-implementation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy provides a benefits package that encompasses a comprehensive set of health interventions stipulated in a contract with the National Health Security Office and the providers, at every level of health service. Further, it is made up of two different components: the health promotion and disease preventive package, and the treatment and care package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For budgeting of the programme, it was decided in 2001 that the UCS would use a capitation payment method. In a capitated contract, the physician, hospital or clinic receives fixed, pre-determined monthly payments per patient enrolled in a health plan. The expenses of the UCS are budgeted under an annual close-ended capitation system that includes each facility’s labour costs to ensure tight budget control. The rate of capitation budget of the UCS increased gradually in the first few years, and, more rapidly, since the fiscal year 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unique feature of Thailand’s healthcare system has been its encouragement of active involvement of CSOs (civil society organisations). These have provided volunteers to the government and have also assisted in policy formulation by providing data on healthcare and in implementation through direct intervention in underdeveloped areas of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time where the just and equitable distribution of healthcare services is becoming an increasingly contentious issue around the world, Thailand has shown that even a middle-income developing country can attain fiscally-responsible universal healthcare. Thailand has cut child mortality rates alongside saving adult lives by providing treatments like antiretroviral therapies and renal replacement therapy. Catastrophic health spending that tends to push people into poverty has been significantly slashed. The correlation between poverty and infant mortality has disappeared and an improvement in the number of people that were prevented from going to work through illness, particularly at the older end of the workforce has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 400 million people across the globe still lacking access to healthcare, Thailand’s universal coverage scheme emphasises on focusing on primary health care units by employing methods that are fair, efficient and sustainable. Governments must show immense political commitment, and accountability must be introduced at multiple stages through the creation of several stakeholders and involvement of CSOs to create a system that is fast, effective and equitable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashima Makhija</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">In 2000, Thailand was in the midst of a healthcare crisis.

It’s easy to criticise the failures of the West or endlessly discuss the history of the conflict, but there is one topic that truly plays a central role: religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood, dirt, and money — or a combination of the three — are responsible for virtually all conflicts. Of course, the Arab-Israeli conflict is no exception, but on a fundamental level, the radicals on both sides see this as a religious struggle. In the current generation, we tend to secularise everything so that we can pretend to scientifically map out a solution. But with conflict as complicated as the Arab-Israeli conflict, it’s easy to wrap ourselves with the blanket of self-pity and proclaim “Oh! It’s just so complicated. So many different perspectives and feelings. I’ll just never understand it!” It is true that we will never solve the conflict with the systematic precisions given to us by science because not every societal problem can be solved in such a manner. If we want to progress, we have to move beyond the fact no one will completely understand everything about the conflict. However, we must still strive to understand it. Even if religion seems strange or difficult to understand for some, it is essential for one to recognise the control it has over people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I must highlight my shortcomings. One popular saying I encountered while travelling to Israel was “two Jews have five opinions.” By this, the saying means that there are a lot of internal disagreements within the Jewish community. So when I write “The Jews believe this…” or “Muslims have faith that…”, I implore you to take it with a grain of salt. Every religion is filled with people who dissent on virtually every aspect. There are very few dogmas or beliefs completely agreed upon by an entire religion. Even among radicals, the interpretations of those dogmas are bitterly disputed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask any religious person, even those who have spent decades training and study, if they understand their own religion. I anxiously await to hear back from you. Until you find that person, the world will keep on rotating while the Israeli and Palestinian children die. We will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; understand even just one perspective of this conflict, however, we can (and must) strive to at least understand where both sides are coming from. The Arab-Israel conflict is very much religious conflict. Not just between Jews and Muslims, but also between the different factions within those faiths, in addition to many other religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Israel and Palestine have religious sites sacred to Christians and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Bah%C3%A1%E2%80%99i+Holy+Places&quot;&gt;Baha’i&lt;/a&gt; (and probably more religions), the local population is mostly made up of Jews in Israel and Muslims in Palestine. Although the minorities play a role in the history and international relations, the chief actors — Israel and Palestine — have undeniable ties to the religion of their majorities. Therefore, if one does not understand religion, they will never understand this conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my dear secular readers, religion may superficially seem like a way of life or a set of traditions, but if that is the extent of your view of religion, then allow me to correct your course. This may be true for a casual religious observer, but we are not solely dealing with casual observers, we are dealing with hardliners and fundamentalists. Now I consider myself to be a Christian fundamentalist, so allow me to explain what ‘fundamentalism’ means. Essentially when one is seeking to get to the fundamentals of one’s religion, they are a fundamentalist. For some, it means pursuing a message of peace and love, for others, their perception of the fundamentals of their religion is to rid themselves (and others) of impurity by any means necessary. Again, even within fundamentalists, you can see a wide range of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a person may arrange their day-to-day schedule or diet around their religion. Perhaps take special holidays and be extra motivated to spend time with their family. But any serious or dedicated religious person will tell you, it is also a philosophy. It’s a framework for understanding how the world works and how you must act every day. Both Jews and Muslims may agree to pray often, not eat pork, celebrate certain holidays, or go to a special building for worship, but if you think that makes them essentially the same, you’re a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are both Abrahamic religions, they both admire similar people (such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Elijah to name a few), and they both love a good falafel. But these are all superficial things. Muslims believe the Jewish sacred law books (the Torah) have been corrupted, and their holy book (the Quran), which was completed over a thousand years later, is the true word of God. The fundamentalist Jewish zionists believe God has given them all of the land held by the Palestinians. These are two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different religions. To expect them to put aside years of bloodshed is one thing, but to expect them to live without resentment for the other’s disrespect for their texts is not an expectation to be taken lightly. Nevertheless, if there is to be peace between Jews and Muslims, what should be the extent of our hopes? And how do we get there? Do we ask them both to just put aside their history? Their faith? Or we ask both of them to search for the fundamentals of their religion. What is the most fundamental aspect of religion? To look after the widows and orphans. Be you a Jew, Muslim, Chrisitan, Buddist, or Scientologist, if this act is not being done, how can you be so sure your religion — or your interpretation of your religion — is being fundamentally carried out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are voices of wisdom and charity on both sides. But because this conflict is so frustrating, people are giving ear to the voices of violence and hatred. In order to preserve peace, we must seek to give a stronger platform to the radicals. Not the radicals for their own religion, but the radicals for peace, justice and love. The radicals for those fundamental virtues all humans strive to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alex Madajian</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">I have written previously about the Arab-Israeli conflict twice now, but I’ve left out one aspect that none of us wants to talk about.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for the West and it’s involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict. On one hand, it’s wonderful to know so many people in the United States and Europe care about resolving the conflict. But on the other hand, there is a strong lack of understanding of the fundamental aspects concerning the conflict. At its core, this conflict is a Middle-Eastern conflict with Middle-Eastern people. Yes, Western powers have played a role in both its history and present situation. But a major reason why everything is messed-up is because they didn’t understand the situation then, nor do they now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is to be done? Abandon everything and pretend that the situation doesn’t exist? Or do we just turn the whole region to glass? I would make the case, we should first take a step back, and realise our own prejudices and perceptions have always given us a flawed view of the situation. We cannot talk about what we should do when we don’t even know what has already been done, and what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now first, let me apologise. For me to say ‘the West’ is extremely misleading. There are dozens of countries and hundreds of agendas and perspectives within those countries of ‘the West.’ Each has varying degrees of concern for the conflict. Obviously, I cannot go through them all, but I would like to highlight two major views, and explain how they miss the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the view I am most familiar with from my upbringing: Evangelical Zionism. Now both Evangelicals and Zionists come in many different degrees of radicalness that emphasises different things. Essentially, these are people who are fundamentalist Christians (usually not Jewish, but they could be Messianic Jews or ethnic Jews who converted to Christianity) who believe God has given the Jewish people a divine right to the land from &lt;a href=&quot;https://temple-news.com/what-does-from-the-river-to-the-sea-mean/&quot;&gt;the Jordan River to the Mediterranean sea&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s important to note, they usually are just unaware of the situation of the Palestinians. Although many who hold a “river to sea” mentality &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/israel-zionism/2018/12/why-the-slogan-from-the-river-to-the-sea-is-a-call-for-the-destruction-of-israel/&quot;&gt;do operate with malice&lt;/a&gt;, this group is usually just oblivious to the injustice they would create. Many don’t even realise Christians both live and worship in the Palestinian territories. Western media sometimes depicts the Palestinians as crazy terrorists who will stop at nothing to murder innocent Jews. Although that may be true for radicals within Hamas, the majority of the Palestinians prefer to avoid as much violence as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Evangelical Zionists take a fundamental interpretation of the Bible, some see any nation as obstructing Israel as rebellious against God. Thus, they are staunch supporters for the United States and Europe to support Israel. What they get wrong however, is the Bible does not give the government of Israel a green-light to do whatever they wish. Again, the Evangelical Zionists are not malicious people, they are simply ignorant of many aspects of the situation. Perhaps they may visit Israel once every other year with their local church, have notifications on their phone that Rockets were fired into Israel from the Gaza strip, or follow the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) on Facebook. What they must realise is Israel by no means is a perfect country or government. To believe it has an inherent right to the land which surpasses the rights of the people currently living there is both situational and even Biblical ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I consider myself an Evangelical Christian. I do believe Israel has a right to exist. However, I am not anti-Palestine and I would be very reluctant to call myself a Zionist. Where I stand is I believe the human and civil rights of both sides must be protected and should be without the expense of the other. From a Biblical perspective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A15-68&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;God does give conditions&lt;/a&gt; to the nation of Israel, that if they are righteous he will bless them, and if they stray from God’s commandments, he will punish them. Evangelical Zionists tend to emphasise God’s blessing, but mysteriously ignore God’s warning. I can’t imagine God favouring a country that potentially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A15-68&amp;amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;leads the Middle-East in abortions&lt;/a&gt;. That being said, Israel is comparatively one of the best Middle-East for freedom of worship. Nevertheless, they just have a long way to go before they can claim they have God’s blessing to do anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the more Left-wing side of the West, we have the BDS movement. For those who do not know, BDS stands for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds&quot;&gt;a movement which seeks&lt;/a&gt; to remove recognition and international economic activity for the state of Israel and believes it’s membership from international bodies such as the UN should be suspended. It’s very popular on many Western college campuses, and usually causes many young people to join their ranks because they are inspired by the message of freedom and ending oppression against the Palestinians. Many accuse &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/world/middleeast/bds-israel-boycott-antisemitic.html&quot;&gt;the BDS movement to be anti-Semitic, but the leadership denies it&lt;/a&gt;. But does it actually help the Palestinians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some Palestinians think the BDS movement &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-palestinian-case-against-bds&quot;&gt;isn’t helping their plight&lt;/a&gt;. Even the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-we-do-not-support-the-boycott-of-israel/&quot;&gt;stated they do not want anyone to boycott the state of Israel&lt;/a&gt;. The reason why is because many Palestinians will cross the border and work in Israel. By boycotting Israeli businesses and forcing them to shut-down, they give the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_30-4-2019-labour-en.pdf&quot;&gt;already heavily unemployed&lt;/a&gt; Palestinians even fewer jobs. Not to mention, Israel and Palestine trade with each other. To economically hurt Israel, is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.albawaba.com/business/ordinary-palestinians-full-support-bds-impossible-712178&quot;&gt;hurt the Palestinians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the point of all this? Hopefully, everyone reading this will realise that “taking a side” is not something that ought to be done recklessly.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://thepangean.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict-I&quot;&gt;I’ve stated it before&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll state it again. The problem with the conflict is that Israel is scared of violent radicals. So they increase their security measures which infringe on the civil rights (and sometimes human rights) of the Palestinians. This causes them and their Arab neighbours to grow frustrated and become radicalised. The radicalisation reinforces Israel’s fear, and the downward spiral continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can the West help break the cycle? It has the potential to help — but it also can make things worse. One could argue the modern conflict started with the British mandate which reorganised the different countries in the Middle-East and drew borders in seemingly random and uncalculated methods. On top of that, forcibly removing some Palestinians from their homes and replacing those areas with Jewish refugees from Europe was bound to cause major chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignorance has caused and perpetuated many other problems around the world, and the Arab-Israeli conflict is no exception. So what can the West do to mitigate or resolve the conflict? First, and most importantly, be informed. Not just by reading the news and history, but also by having conversations with Palestinians and Israelis. Ask what is their personal stake in the conflict, what is their perspective, and what they think is the potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, know that violence is not the answer. Violence only causes more resentment and revenge, which in term causes more violence, thus perpetuating the cycle. Anyone — be they Arab or Jewish — who seeks violence or force as a solution should be avoided. Ignore people who believe the other side has no right to live. Don’t give a platform to ideologies who are more interested in “their tribe” than the overall situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, build bridges of peace. People in the West should serve as &lt;em&gt;mediators&lt;/em&gt;. It’s only natural to pick sides in any conflict (especially if you have a Western mindset), but if we are to help ‘our side’ the best way is by helping &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sides. If one side is hurt, so is the other. If one side prospers, the other could also benefit. The West’s role in the conflict should be to rise above the tribal ‘our side versus their side’ mentality. Instead, they ought to work to bring the two people together. Deradicalisation will come through a strong mutual understanding. Unfortunately, both sides live in societies that teach their children to resent the other. Palestinians and Israelis rarely understand the issues or perspective of the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful solution to the conflict &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be a conscious intergenerational effort. The best way the West could help is by facilitating such an effort. But that can only begin if the West realises it is not some white knight that will save all the poor, oppressed people. The West, at best, ought to serve as a &lt;em&gt;mediator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;educator&lt;/em&gt; which strives to help both sides come to peace. Better a teacher, guide, and friend, than a warrior looking for a righteous cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alex Madajian</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">In one of the most complicated conflicts on the international stage, you would think there would be a massive effort to understand the conflict on its own terms.

We live in an age of convenience and an on-demand economy. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that one would rather get their groceries home-delivered than go out and buy them when they could be using that time to catch up on their work, especially if you are getting a discount on your online order. This particular rule applies to almost every commodity in our lives, from food items to books to clothes. It is an unarguable fact that online shopping has made our daily functioning far more efficient and easy than before. Imagining a world where I would have to step out of the comforts of my home every time I need to buy something sounds unwelcoming. Amazon, Flipkart and eBay are the self-care essentials that every millennial would swear by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in the last 18 months, Amazon has come under fire for anti-competitive activities in several countries, particularly Germany, India, Spain, the USA and the European Union (EU). While it managed to settle disputes in Germany ahead of the investigation in the EU, the tech giant is currently struggling under the combined forces of investigation in various countries. The reason for Amazon’s recent yet potentially jeopardising trysts lies in the Sherman Act of 1980 passed in the United States, it was the first ‘Modern Antitrust’ law. Following their lead, many countries implemented a slightly modified version of the Sherman Act, along with competition enforcement authorities in their own countries. A particular complexity arising out of this trend is that firms operating globally would fall under the jurisdiction of multiple antitrust laws. So while laws in South Africa would focus on bringing more South African companies in the economy, laws in India would aim to protect small and medium scale firms from foreign competition. Therefore, antitrust laws differ depending upon the social and economic needs of a particular country. They also act as a barrier to large companies from forming a global merger and gaining access to a larger share of markets to effectively reduce competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while globally diverse antitrust laws may have the particular benefit in avoiding powerful mergers, it does introduce obstacles in the form of technicalities that would allow a firm to get away with exploitation and unfair trade practices. To avoid that, there are the basic principles in antitrust legislation that are universally accepted to minimise the chances of the aforementioned instance occuring, however, they may be implemented according to the nation’s preferences. These three principles are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;: Companies cannot divide markets based on regional or geographical locations amongst themselves because such division leads to lesser choices for the consumer and consequently, lesser bargaining power for them and lesser competition among the firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price fixing by companies&lt;/strong&gt;: Companies cannot fix prices amongst themselves and have to let the market forces (or the government) determine the price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopolies formed due to predatory practices&lt;/strong&gt;: Monopoly refers to a company that has the greatest share of the market, such that they can easily influence prices. Monopolies formed when a firm prevents other firms from selling goods is an example of predatory practice. There are various forms of predatory practices and Amazon is currently accused of indulging in a combination of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having understood what these principles are, we must understand why these laws are significant. The antitrust laws came into existence for the protection of rights of the consumer and to ensure that the consumers have the freedom to choose and purchase a product without being bullied or manipulated into making that choice. It ensures fair prices and good quality products for the consumer. How this necessarily works is through the mechanism of competition. For instance, if a firm cannot form a monopoly or manipulate the consumers into buying their product, they would have to compete with the other firms based on merit and quality, which would result in giving the consumer a really good product at competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One cannot argue against the ingenuity of Amazon’s business model. The same applies to its antitrust predatory activities. Initially, the small retailers found Amazon’s online selling platform a most beneficial mechanism to expand their market outreach, and trade in geographically unavailable locations. Amazon repaid their trust by using the sales and product database from these small retailers registered on their site to launch similar products under their brand name but with the added advantage of having minimum costs and ready-made data available of the most receptive customers. Amazon has been analysing these data reports from the local retailers for its own benefit. They have also slashed their prices to an unmatched level. While this may imply that Amazon would suffer losses initially, it is guaranteed that in the future, they would start earning profit or raise prices to earn profit once they establish their dominance by capturing the largest portion of the market through their extremely low prices. In essence, Amazon loses money to gain market share. This act is known as predatory pricing and is one of the most difficult to prove forms of violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why Amazon has been able to get away with this in so many countries it deals with is because it has not violated one of the core dictates of antitrust laws, that is, consumer welfare. Amazon is notorious for its good quality products and cheap delivery at the most minimal prices. Additionally, a major element of the Amazon enterprises, the Amazon web service is responsible for providing facilities such as cybersecurity, server space and all essential components that any business needs to operate on the internet. Furthermore, almost all major websites ranging from Spotify, Adobe to the CIA use Amazon web services, making Amazon almost indispensable to the virtual and tech world. Hence, most countries are unwilling to hold Amazon accountable or to even look into this matter. No one wants to mess up with someone who single-handedly controls a major chunk of essential online portals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small-to-medium retailers and indigenous firms face the consequences of willful ignorance of their governments. Local retailers lose out on their most contributing consumers and consequently run out of business because of Amazon’s poaching resulting in large scale unemployment and dissatisfaction amongst the poor and middle-class workers. Amazon also works its poor and mostly immigrant workers to the bone to provide its express delivery services. Amazon workers are criminally underpaid and overworked as a result of predatory pricing and have no respite because of lack of government interference or regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we were to consider the benefits of consumer welfare through the express delivery of quality goods at cheap prices, there is no guarantee that such would be the case in the long run, or that by running small firms out of business and eliminating competition, Amazon will not be depriving the consumers of different and perhaps better choices in the future. Considering the aforementioned consequences, the trade-off between assumed consumer welfare and not holding Amazon accountable seems mightily unfair.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidhi Arora</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">One of the most common descriptors of an average millennial would be their constant need for instant gratification.

&lt;p&gt;India, a behemoth economy with a great civilisation, heritage and the immense possibility of creating global influence, has been attaining the status of being one of the most formidable nations in recent times. In accordance with the latest GDP estimates, India is exhibited as the fifth-largest economy in the world with a nominal GDP of $2.9 trillion. The Modi-led government has set an exalted yet magnificent objective of seeing India maturing into a ‘Five Trillion Dollar’ economy by the end of the ‘Modi 2.0 era’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goal might seem a little intimidating or a bridge too far, but the fact is that every developing nation needs an ambitious target so that every sector, company and all other essential stakeholders align themselves and put emphasis on reaching it. Before we examine the attainability of this ambition, let us know how much of a growth rate and GDP value would be required for the target. With inflation of 3.5% and keeping rupee depreciation under check, a nominal growth of 11.5% is paramount for realising the 5 trillion mark to reap a real growth rate of about 8-9%. Sustaining such a significant rate of growth is very challenging for any economy and substantially arduous for India owing to its high unemployment rate of 6.1%, additionally over three hundred thousand people have lost their jobs due to the crumbling auto sector coupled with growth rate hovering around just 5% in the April-June quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since Independence, India has become a $2 trillion nation and within the last five years, it has added a feather of $1 trillion to its cap of GDP value. Therefore, acquiring that 5 trillion mark seems pretty practical. India has shown a fairly robust and persistent record of healthy growth drivers and the recent leapfrogging of 23 notches to rank 77th in the Ease of Doing Business index paves the way for reaching that goal. While no one can deny the reality that certain industries are facing downswing or recessionary conditions, there exist many sectors like IT and BPO service exports which are doing exceedingly well amidst the low global growth of 3.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question is the possibility to expand at 9%. Well, it is conceivable and other countries have made it possible. For instance, Russia developed exponentially between the 1950’s and 1970’s at over 10% per annum. Even China (in the early 1990’s) and USA (1965-1975) are a testimony to the fact that growth over 10% is plausible. To accomplish this grand vision, every Indian state must demonstrate healthy signs of progress and this is seemingly true for the BIMARU states (Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and UP). In 2017-18, Bihar outran other states by displaying 11.3% growth, which was way above the overall economic growth of 6.7%. In fact, all but one of these ‘poor BIMARU states’, grew more than the national average implying enhanced law and order conditions and business-amiable government. Thus, the likelihood of unleashing the potential of every state is apparently pretty high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, India’s stable inflation rate (around 3%) and low global inflationary trends is a favourable situation for the country. If the rupee-dollar foreign exchange rate is also maintained and the rupee does not depreciate considerably, achieving the target is credible. The government is set to pump in $1.4 trillion for infrastructure investments to make developments in highways, railways, airports, power sectors, etc. Funding will also be backed by international players. For example, the UAE will invest $75 billion and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) will supposedly spend $1 trillion for boosting the Indian infrastructure sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in order to become a 5 trillion economy, India needs to make remarkable structural and sectoral moderations and initiate various reforms. Reforms like the latest corporate tax cuts (from 35% to 25%) proved fruitful for the economy as the stock market reacted positively, strengthening exports and enticing investors. With the ongoing economic tussle between the US and China, MNCs are on the lookout for a substitute manufacturing hub. Currently, holding just 2% of the global trade market share, India can reap the benefits of this war by minimising trade barriers and leveraging such opportunities by upgrading trade value chains. In fact, the manufacturing sector has the capability to absorb surplus labour from the agricultural or any informal sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service sector has been on the rise lately with a contribution of up to 56.5% of GDP but employing only 30% of people. With automation around the corner and chances of loss in jobs in export-intensive IT sector, development of expertise in IoT, AI, Machine Learning, etc. will definitely boost the economy. Even the travel and tourism sector with 10% GDP share, providing 40 million jobs, can grow manifold by project-driven investments in medical tourism, tourist safety and budget hotels. Healthcare sector also calls for overall transformation as over 100 million workers would be desired globally in the coming years. Service and industry sectors have the greatest possibilities of value additions, and, therefore, skilled labour and strategic investments would assist heavily in economic expansion. Along with this, various land reforms would be necessary to facilitate growth. Major Indian cities, such as Bangalore, Mumbai have high potential to become global hubs, hence, tactical budget allocations and investments can boost the overall economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus should also be placed on establishing environment-friendly ways as it is an impediment to the 5 trillion economy dream. According to the World Bank report, environmental degradation costs India $80 billion per year. To tackle this, the creation of green jobs and community development through various already existing organisations can be done. Environmental or carbon taxes prove advantageous. Also, cutting down on oil imports can serve the dual purpose of opening up a ₹400 billion domestic market in the aviation sector whilst simultaneously mitigating environmental pollution by the usage of biofuels. According to the Union Road &amp;amp; Transport Minister, Nitin Gadkari, his Ministry is already taking crucial steps in this regard. Investments would entail a demand boost, creation of capacity, the introduction of new technologies, generation of jobs and enhanced labour productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India cannot prosper if certain states and sectors (like the construction sector) with high untapped potential do not start developing. In fact, state-wise spending must grow. The government’s $5 trillion goal is definitely ambitious but this intent can only be executed through a concrete plan of action. All that is required is a target-based approach, meticulous elimination of all the policy shortcomings and unclogging stalled projects. The aspiration to fulfil the quest with sustained growth can open up employment for over a million young people. A more balanced approach towards development and making sure that the government is able to run a clean, harmonious and efficient mechanism is all that will take to make the dream come alive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sparsh Gupta</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">India will become a $5 Trillion Economy – Attainable or a Pipe Dream?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GDP as a Tool of Economic Misdirection: Moving ‘To and Fro’ on the Growth Bar?</title><link href="/GPD-as-a-Tool-of-Economic-Misdirection" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GDP as a Tool of Economic Misdirection: Moving 'To and Fro' on the Growth Bar?" /><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/GPD-as-a-Tool-of-Economic-Misdirection</id><content type="html" xml:base="/GPD-as-a-Tool-of-Economic-Misdirection">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDP as a Tool of Economic Misdirection: Moving ‘To and Fro’ on the Growth Bar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we really where we predicted? Or are we here because we overestimated? You, me or a few economists are not alone in thinking of GDP as a miscalculated benchmark for national economic well-being. Adjudged as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century, it has long been a closely-watched tool for politicians, economists and journalists alike. But for nearly as long as GDP has been revered, it has faced strong criticism too. And rightly so because it captures what economic historians call a “somewhat arbitrary slice of reality.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period (usually a year). As a relatively broad measure of overall domestic production, it works as a comprehensive scorecard of the country’s economic health. This definition excludes a lot. To name a few, we can look at the following qualitative parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Services have replaced goods, freelancers and agencies are a growing share of the workforce, and value is increasingly derived from intangible assets like design, branding and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Unpaid labour like parental housework and childcare does not figure in, nor does volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many loopholes exist, but let’s focus upon one in particular: &lt;em&gt;inequality&lt;/em&gt;. In recent times, income inequality has shot almost everywhere globally. As per the data summarised by the World Economic Forum, one scenario exists wherein growth is uneven between the poorest 50%, the middle 40% and the richest 10%. While earners at all income levels receive some benefit, nearly half of the population saw about half of the 5% GDP growth for the total economy. On the other hand, taking another stance, 90% of the population sees none of that growth. In fact, incomes for the bottom 50% actually contract. Still, GDP growth looks strong, let’s say, at 5.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich get Richer: Production Factor and Financial Imbalance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect to ponder upon is that a growing fraction of innovation is not measured at all. In a world where houses are private suites and private cars are Uber/Meru taxis, where a free software upgrade renews old computers, and Facebook, Instagram and YouTube bring hours of entertainment to millions at no price at all, many suspect GDP is becoming an ever more misleading measure. Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. And GDP is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as GDP is widely used as a measure of output, or even as a measure of a country’s well-being, GDP has irrefutable limitations. Conventionally and quite literally, GDP calculates only output that is bought and sold. I have strong reasons to believe that it is a fairly limited approach. First, market transactions are taxable and, therefore, of interest to the exchequer, an important consumer of GDP statistics. Second, they can be influenced by policies to manage aggregate demand. Third, where there are market prices, it is fairly straightforward to put a value on output. This convention means that the so-called “home production”, such as housework or caring for an elderly relative or children, is excluded from GDP even though such unpaid services have considerable value. Fourth, despite the convention, a lot of what is included in GDP lies outside the market economy. Many government services are provided for free, and for decades the value given to such output was simply the cost of provision. It is fairly recently that statisticians have started to measure some bits of public sector output directly, for instance, by counting the number of operations performed by health services or the number of students taught in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Price Parity causing a Hindrance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting for the ever-rising increase in prices over a considerable period of time (inflation, yes) has further complicated the situation. Then comes the adjustments for changes in quality. This year’s iPhone might cost more than last year’s, but if so- it is because it is capable of rendering more. If statisticians focus only on changes in price, they will *overstate the true inflation rate *by missing improvements in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the advent of newer technologies some physical marketable products have turned into digital services, the value of which is harder to track. It seems likely, for instance, that more the physical copies of books are being read to than ever before, but revenue for publications has shrunk by a significant margin from its peak. (Thanks to e-books and kindle?) Consumers once bought newspapers and maps and paid middlemen to book holidays. Now they do much more themselves, an effort which doesn’t show up in GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems do not invalidate or negate the use of GDP but given the significant increase in technological change, they seem likely to grow much more than before, and solutions to them are both hard and imperfect. Measuring the consumer surplus from new or free products relies on calculated assumptions; estimates vary considerably depending on which ones are used!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ankita Punjani</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">GDP as a Tool of Economic Misdirection: Moving ‘To and Fro’ on the Growth Bar?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Beware, You’re Being Watched!</title><link href="/Beware-You-re-Being-Watched" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beware, You’re Being Watched!" /><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Beware-You-re-Being-Watched</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Beware-You-re-Being-Watched">&lt;p&gt;The Netflix show &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; has made its way to one of the most talked-about television shows on social media. It revolves around the creepy but hot stalker who spies on women using telescopes and by physically following them. If you think this merely happens in fiction, wait till the end of this article. Before we begin, this article isn’t about a particular political party acting as the villain, though all of them may be considered so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increased use of technology by criminals, government surveillance is inevitable. In almost every nation, a certain proportion of the population is under the scanner of intelligence agencies. However, the potential mass-scale tracking of the data of all citizens has sparked a grave debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s surveillance systems have access to 100% of all internet activity, with broad surveillance capability based on IP, email addresses, URLs, HTTP, Telenet, or webmail, and even through abroad and blind searches across all traffic in the internet pipe using keywords and key-phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Central Monitoring System (CMS), launched in 2013, is the surveillance project which allows the Indian government to monitor online and telephonic data of citizens. Unlike its American counterpart PRISM, there is no legal recourse for a citizen whose personal details are being misused or leaked from the central or regional database. CMS does not even have any judicial oversight.In India, most orders are signed by either the Central or State Home Secretary. This causes a conflict of interest, as the executive branch is both undertaking law enforcement and providing oversight on its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pursuit of internet monitoring started following the leak of the Amar Singh tapes, with instructions for ensuring the privacy of communications. This mandated all ISPs (Internet Service Providers) to have designated nodal officers for communicating and receiving the intimations for interceptions. Since the government controlled the LIMs (Lawful Intercept and Monitoring Systems), it directly sent software commands and sucked out whatever information is needed from the internet pipe with no intimation to anyone. The lack of a privacy law made it easier for the government to undertake such radical steps. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2008, allowed the government to monitor, intercept, and even block online conversations and websites. The addition of the CMS significantly widened the number of sources and could simplify access to these records. In 2019, the government went even further with this pursuit of privacy, like passing the Data Protection Bill and forming the NATGRID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) aims to allow investigation and law enforcement agencies to access real-time information from data stored with agencies such as the Income Tax Department, banks, insurance companies, Indian Railways, credit card transactions, and more. It is meant to connect public and private databases for ten central intelligence agencies. State agencies, however, will not be allowed access to the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATGRID was first introduced post the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks by the then Home Minister Mr P Chidambaram. After 10 years of delay, on September 12, 2019, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the NATGRID would be functional by the end of 2019. Along with the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS), which will integrate the Central and State crime data, NATGRID will give a suspect’s ‘360-degree’ profile. This system could prevent or detect incidents like the 26/11 attacks, claims the Home Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many concerns regarding the dangers of misuse of this system. The unified pooling of vital information from different resources is vulnerable to cyber attacks or espionage from foreign intelligence agencies. Given the recent WhatsApp data breach, this apprehension needs to be addressed by having proper checks and balances in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, who is watching the notorious &lt;em&gt;chowkidars&lt;/em&gt; (watchmen)? Also, if someone violated your privacy, but you never knew about it, did it even happen? This is where the Data Protection Bill, 2019, becomes important. It is India’s first step towards a privacy framework and sets a framework to govern personal data. The bill is meant to ensure that Indian citizens have control of their data. The bill seeks to localise the storage of data and to set up the Data Protection Authority of India. However, under the bill, not only will your sensitive personal information be stored but also information about you and your online habits. It is a potential avenue for the invasion of privacy because it can reveal many personal aspects. Companies, governments, and political parties can further use these to find the most convincing ways to advertise to you online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has exempted its agencies from the rules that govern the processing of personal data citing national security, public order and friendly relations with foreign states. 24x7 surveillance acts as a major threat to businesses. Businesses are formed on the foundations of security and trust: from the purchase of an item on an e-commerce site to a company’s research mechanisms and technologies. Central databases make attacking a company based on such confidential information easier. All one would have to do to go one-up on you is to attack these databases. It was because of this the USA decided not to impose blanket surveillance. Their idea is “while we may live in a society without human rights, we cannot be in one without functional markets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it allows the government to manipulate the data patterns and wrongly accuse innocent citizens of being criminals. With NATGRID and the Data Protection Bill, the government shall have access to all data. In a world where the government claims that peaceful protests by the students are a threat to national security and anyone can be labelled a terrorist without evidence, the exemptions in the Data Protection Bill become important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government can access private data or government agency data on grounds of sovereignty or public order. This has dangerous implications. While the Indian Constitution recognises the right to privacy, there are very few laws governing government surveillance. Due to this, there is very little legislative oversight, leading to little judicial decision-making regarding surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Acton had famously prophesied that “power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. This peril is more acute when the power is used covertly. Efforts to maintain accountability over intelligence agencies are frequently troublesome. All things considered, intelligence agencies comprise human beings, with their capabilities being circumscribed by human flaws, frailties and defects. Thus, safeguards are unavoidable and unnecessary, unfortunately, or rather, suspiciously, the Indian government seems blissfully unaware of that necessity, betraying its desire to be the stalker in people’s homes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devyani Arora</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">The Netflix show You has made its way to one of the most talked-about television shows on social media.

However, English optimism may not be misguided this time following a strong showing at the last World Cup in Russia that has led to the national team being talked about as genuine contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Three Lions have a wealth of talent at their disposal, albeit distributed somewhat lopsidedly. There is an abundance of terrific right-backs and forwards, a solid crop of central defenders and attacking midfielders but a dearth of quality deep midfielders and goalkeepers. Recent injuries to established internationals such as Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford coupled with breakout seasons from several number 9s means that Gareth Southgate has a selection headache. Southgate has previously said that he selects players based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-southgate/form-not-reputation-the-key-for-englands-southgate-idUKKBN15U0J1&quot;&gt;form and not reputation&lt;/a&gt; and this philosophy could present some tough decisions for him when choosing the forwards for this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Kane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious place to start is with Harry Kane. Over the last 5 years he has established himself as one of the best centre-forwards in the world as well as an undisputed starter for England. The fact that he is England’s captain and boasts a superb international record means that he would normally be the uncontested first choice to lead the line for England at Wembley in their group D opener vs Croatia on June 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Kane tore his hamstring on New Year’s Day, an injury which required surgery, and is now reportedly facing a battle to return before the end of the season. Persistent injuries have contributed to Kane’s league goals per 90 minutes declining in each of the past 3 seasons and it is a similar story for his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optasports.com/services/analytics/advanced-metrics/&quot;&gt;xG (expected goals&lt;/a&gt;) which indicates he is not getting the same quantity or quality of shots that he used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst still an excellent player, he is no longer head and shoulders above every other English striker and, with the increased competition, it may be worth considering whether it would be beneficial starting Kane at the Euros if he isn’t fully fit. Kane has been known to rush himself back from injury whilst still not appearing to be fully fit, such as in the Champions League final vs Liverpool where he replaced hat-trick hero Lucas Moura and had minimal impact on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the World Cup in Russia, Kane didn’t look himself in the knockout rounds (despite winning the Golden Boot), lacking sharpness and not having the effect on games that he often has for Tottenham. So, whilst Kane’s resume speaks for itself, it’s imperative England have a strong selection of strikers to not only back him up but provide serious competition for his place in the XI to ensure he is only playing because he is the best option for England and not because of his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tammy Abraham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a disappointing loan spell at Swansea 2 seasons ago, Tammy Abraham has now shown that he is not only a capable top flight striker, but one of the best strikers in the league. He has filled a gap in Chelsea’s frontline that had been gaping since Diego Costa’s departure, netting 13 times in 24 Premier League games this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 22 year old had been prolific at Championship level, with 48 goals in 78 games as a youngster, but what has been really impressive is his all-round game which has proven he is more than a poacher. Abraham’s 6ft 3 frame supplements his strong hold-up play and he has shown an array of nice touches and combinations with the likes of Willian and Christian Pulisic. This is promising for his fit in the England set-up where he would likely play alongside 2 of Jadon Sancho, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford, forming a dynamic front 3 where he can act as a perfect foil for the speedy, direct wingers. The goals have dried up a bit for Abraham of late, with only 2 in his last 9 league games but should he finish the season strongly then he’d have to feel confident about securing a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus Rashford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a few weeks younger than the Chelsea sharpshooter, Marcus Rashford has won 34 more caps than Tammy Abraham and will be aiming to feature in a third consecutive international tournament. Over 200 appearances for Manchester United emphasise his experience compared to some of his contemporaries and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Squawka/status/1203371920781168640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1203371920781168640&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.squawka.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fmarcus-rashford-man-utd-big-game-specialist-premier-league&quot;&gt;his reputation as a big game player&lt;/a&gt; means Southgate will have no qualms about throwing him in at the deep end this summer. He did just that at the World Cup two summers ago, subbing him on in every knockout match, though Rashford largely failed to have the desired impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mancunian has undoubtedly improved since then and was having by far the best season of his career (19 goals in 31 games) before picking up a back injury which is expected to keep him out for a few more weeks. He was starting to look as though he was on his way to becoming an elite forward and, should there be no complications with his recovery, he is almost certain to book a place in the squad for Euro 2020. One attribute he has in his favour when compared to someone like Kane or Abraham is his positional versatility which would allow him to feature as a main centre-forward, a support striker or a winger depending on what is required this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamie Vardy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting sporadically for England since 2015, Jamie Vardy elected to retire from international football after the 2018 World Cup. Despite currently being the Premier League’s top scorer, there has been little indication that he intends to go back on his word and make himself available for selection again. There have been some reports he would only do so if he were offered a guaranteed place in the side and this would not be a wise choice, despite another excellent season from the veteran. Vardy has made minimal impact in previous tournaments due to a severe lack of game time and a set-up dissimilar from the one that he thrives in at Leicester. If he isn’t going to be a starter then his place as a backup in the squad would be better served going to a younger player who can learn from the experience, whilst Vardy can continue to enjoy his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominic Calvert-Lewin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;24 games into this season, Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin has doubled his goal tally from his first 3 Premier League campaigns, currently sitting on 11 goals. He is starting more often than he did in those previous seasons, and the increased opportunity has resulted in the Sheffield native playing with a newfound confidence in front of goal. He was always a promising, all-action forward but he has now added the vital missing ingredient to his game - goals. His versatility bodes well for his Euro 2020 hopes - he can function as a target man, play up front in a 2 and has even played out wide in the past. Players like him have proved to have a place in previous England squads at major tournaments - think of him in the Danny Welbeck mould, or Emile Heskey (at a push), a complementary forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Callum Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callum Wilson played 3 times for England last year and looked to be on his way to cementing a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad. The Bournemouth frontman’s form, however, has nosedived since those caps and he only recently ended a 15 match goalless run in the league which has moved him to the periphery of international consideration. His manager, Eddie Howe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/callum-wilson-bournemouth-england-euro-2020-squad-gareth-southgate-a9300211.html&quot;&gt;still believes he can secure a place in the Euro squad&lt;/a&gt;, but even with an upturn in form it seems the 27-year old would have to rely on injuries if he wants to board the plane over some of his competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Ings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danny Ings has been one of the Premier League’s surprise packages this season, almost single-handedly carrying the goalscoring burden for a Southampton side that finds itself in mid-table after a tricky start. He has scored more than 4 times as many goals compared to any of his teammates and this form has inevitably led to him being touted for an England recall, 5 years after his only cap. Whilst there is no denying that Ings is having an impressive season and no-one would begrudge him a place in the squad, he is one of the more limited striking options that England have. He is a great poacher and has a good workrate but outside of that perhaps doesn’t quite have the all-round game and versatility to match some other England options. Darren Bent was an excellent poacher and scored 24 Premier League goals in the 2009/10 season for mid-table Sunderland but was omitted from the World Cup squad that summer and it may be a similar story for Ings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England strikers at recent tournaments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When going over England’s forwards, it’s worth taking a look at what they have historically done in regards to squad selection to get a feel for what they may do this summer. In the 5 major tournaments last decade, they would typically take 4 or 5 striking options. Amongst these, there is a wide range of profiles: poacher (Defoe), target man (Crouch), speed demon (Vardy), second striker (Rooney), all-rounder (Kane) etc. Target men such as Crouch, Carroll, Lambert, Heskey have fallen out of fashion in recent years as in 2018 England opted for 4 pacey strikers in the squad alongside Harry Kane. This would seemingly have been to provide a counter-attacking threat, though the quartet didn’t manage a goal between them. Vardy and Rashford offered many of the same strengths and it is arguable that having them plus Danny Welbeck made each other redundant and a different profile of striker would have been preferable. Abraham and Calvert-Lewin were still playing for the U21s at this time but both have developed significantly since then and present different options to the likes of Rashford and Raheem Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Normally a striker, but often played in a different position this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past Champions’ forward options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World and European champions typically took fewer strikers than England did last decade. Whilst simply taking fewer numbers, they would also play midfielders like Mario Gotze or Cesc Fabregas as the most advanced attackers which gave them the option of utilising an extra body to beef up the midfield and overwhelm the opposition. Despite England moving away from a traditional target man up top in recent years, the current World Champions found great success with one. Olivier Giroud replaced Ousmane Dembele in France’s XI after they scraped past Australia in their opener and the Chelsea striker managed to have a positive effect on the team as a whole despite going the whole competition without a shot on target. Giroud allowed Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann to thrive in a way that England may hope someone such as Harry Kane or Tammy Abraham can emulate with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Raheem Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what England have at their disposal, it’s important that they select a range of profiles that can each offer something different whilst at the same time complementing each other. It’s also crucial to not select any ‘dead-weight’ in the squad, like Danny Welbeck who hardly featured at last year’s World Cup. Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Tammy Abraham should be shoe-ins for the squad, whilst Dominic-Calvert Lewin and Danny Ings are right outside looking in. Raheem Sterling can also play up front. Sterling plus the aforementioned 3 present very strong options for an England team that could go all the way this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Samuel Hogan</name></author><category term="sports" /><category term="football" /><summary type="html">Euro 2020 is fast approaching, which means it’s time for England to convince themselves that football is finally coming home.
