Lisbon’s start-up scene is thriving and with investment from the government and strong support from the private sector, this hidden gem of a city is really starting to garner attention not just from tourists, but also from young entrepreneurs around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision of Lisbon as a premier start-up city began nearly a decade ago. The Mayor of Lisbon at the time, António Costa, who is now the Prime Minister of Portugal, introduced Startup Lisboa. This &lt;em&gt;incubator&lt;/em&gt; project is located right in the centre of the city, occupying what were historic buildings that had fallen into disuse. Its aims are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Support the creation of companies and entrepreneurs in their first years of activity, to promote job creation, and aid the urban, social, and economic vitality of Lisbon.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last seven years, its success has been extremely impressive. It has supported around 400 start-ups, created 3,500 jobs and worked with entrepreneurs from more than 40 different countries. Well-known examples of companies that were assisted by Startup Lisboa include Uniplaces, a market leader in student accommodation which I myself used during my time spent in Lisbon. Startup Lisboa is just one of several incubator programmes that are supporting the growth of the various companies trying to establish themselves in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor has been the Startup Visa, which is a residence visa scheme for entrepreneurs, aiming to attract investment, talent and innovation capacity. This was the first of its kind within Europe, demonstrating the forward-thinking attitude of the Portuguese government. Other visa settlement plans such as the Golden Visa have helped to bring foreign capital into the country, attracting nearly €5 billion of investment into Portugal since the scheme’s creation in 2012. Although a disproportionate amount of this investment has gone into property, it has still helped Lisbon to attract both smaller start-ups and bigger tech players. For example, last year, Google built a new support centre in Oeiras, on the outskirts of Lisbon, creating 500 jobs and establishing Lisbon as a hub for their operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisbon, and indeed Portugal, have also harnessed recent political developments to their advantage. Portugal IN is a temporary task force created by the government to capitalise on Brexit uncertainty. Historic links between the countries, regular flights, widespread knowledge of English, a similar time zone, and the British tourist’s partiality to a Portuguese package holidays are all strong motivators for British companies to expand to Portugal in these times of European uncertainty. Furthermore, rent prices and the cost of living is significantly lower in Lisbon than in London. Unlike some other European business hubs, Lisbon’s culture is one of its main draws and despite its smaller size compared to London, it more than makes up with its sunshine, vibrant society, relaxed atmosphere and spirit of work. In a world where work is becoming more agile and mobile, factors such as quality of life are becoming increasingly important in deciding where a business or employee should be based. In this way, Lisbon has and continues to develop an edge over its European counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another significant move for the Portuguese capital, Web Summit, the largest tech conference in Europe—to which &lt;em&gt;The Pangean&lt;/em&gt; was a media partner this year—has decided to move from Dublin to Lisbon for the last few years, thereby helping to establish the legitimacy of Lisbon as a key player in the technology sphere. Developments in the Portuguese education system have helped to support the political and social changes mentioned earlier. Focus on technology skills and engineering, coupled with the relatively low costs of living have created an abundance of local skilled labour for these domestic and international start-ups. Indeed, Portugal ranks very highly in government expenditure on education, female representation in the labour force and availability of skilled labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in the start-up scene has been made all the more important due to the current state of the economy in Portugal. Indeed, there are some critical issues on a national level. GDP per capita lags considerably behind other European countries; in 2018, it was nearly $10,000 less the EU average. Wages too have remained far below Western averages. Though it can be said that this cheap labour is part of the reason why international companies have been willing to invest in Portugal. Rising rents due to tourism and economic expansion in cities such as Lisbon and Porto are pushing locals out of the city. There has also been a lack of public investment, and anyone who has lived in Portugal will be able to cite the problems with outdated, inefficient infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that said, there is cause for optimism. In recent years, the economy has shown consistent growth and unemployment has fallen from the high of 17.4% at the beginning of 2013 to a decent 6.6% as of September 2019. Household disposable income is rising at a rate of 2.9%, a figure which is higher than the UK, US, Denmark and Sweden. Moreover, the emergence of this exciting start-up culture can only serve to improve the Portuguese economic outlook and help modernise this Iberian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is stands, it seems that comparisons between Lisbon and Silicon Valley are only set to increase, with the Portuguese capital heavily promoting the image of a city attractive for its natural beauty and business opportunities. With Lisbon based start-ups raising hundreds of millions of Euros in investment, the favourable economic and political environment promoted by the local and national government has and continues to be successful, with the start-up boom in Lisbon here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Harris</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">Aside from its amazing culture, stunning beaches and delicious cuisine, there is another reason why Lisbon is competing as one of the most vibrant and exciting cities in Europe.

But in notoriety, well, I shall leave the words unsaid.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a regular Christmas party or for that matter, even at the bar or the library, if you declare you are an Everest summiteer, you’ll undoubtedly be catapulted to instant fame and accorded the title of a hero, much more than the average fifteen-minutes-of-fame the average Joe achieves in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you have climbed a mountain which goes by the name of K2 (or Mount Godwin Austen), your jubilant declaration is likely to meet with a horde of confused stares. Maybe, just maybe, you’ll receive a couple of congratulations, although half-hearted ones at that. And only if you are lucky, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people have never heard of K2 or really any mountain other than Everest, of course. In mountaineering parlance, it is the same way a ‘novice’ climber who is ‘escorted’ up Everest thanks his lead guide profusely but utterly overlooks the contribution of the Sherpas, without whose help any ascent would be impossible. In cricketing parlance, it would be akin to people having heard of a certain Andre Russell, but not a Ryan Harris. However, it wouldn’t be right to blame them since they hardly know better. After all, all of us in school only learnt that the highest (mind you, not the tallest - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2015/11/25/tallest-mountain-in-the-world-debatable/#322bb80c221c&quot;&gt;the tallest is Mauna Kea, Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;) mountain in the world is Mount Everest, and that was it. Consider this - we learnt the highest mountain was Mount Everest, however what we never learnt is why or what makes it the highest et cetera, which probably would have been the more important question. But that is another story, for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K2, situated in the Karakoram range of Northern Pakistan, is the second highest mountain in the world, rising a staggering 8,611 metres above sea level. To put that into perspective, imagine going vertically upwards for more than eight kilometres. Daunting, eh? Well for all it’s height, it still falls short of Everest’s by the length of a couple of football fields, something which, I daresay, has haunted it since eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, The Himalayas, The Karakoram and The Hindu Kush Mountains boast some of the highest mountains in the world, with all of the fourteen ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-thousander&quot;&gt;eight-thousanders&lt;/a&gt;’ (mountains reaching a height of 8000 m) situated in one of the former two ranges and the latter boasting the highest number of ‘seven-thousanders’. Most of these mountains are located in either Nepal, Tibet, Pakistan or Afghanistan. However, even India and China find themselves taking a slice of the cake, with a number of mountains sitting on the borders of these countries, most notably Kanchenjunga (India-Nepal) and K2 (Pakistan-China).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the human body simply lacks the ability to survive, let alone function, at the kind of heights we are talking about here. And at a point in time that happens, even attempting to climb a structure which covers one’s entire vision of the horizon from even as much as 100 miles afar, becomes an intrinsically irrational act. Regardless, despite the obvious fallacy of the thought, the 1900’s saw the birth of the belief that these mountains could be climbed, with more than a few tragic cases of going to the extent of believing that nature could be overpowered. However, until 1950, none of the eight-thousanders were climbed, with the more prominent ones to have failed including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory&quot;&gt;George Leigh Mallory and Andrew Irvine&lt;/a&gt;. After Maurice Herzog climbed the mountain with the highest ascent-to-fatality ratio, Annapurna, in 1950, the belief saw a mighty resurgence, with expeditions one after the other. And when the hallowed Everest was finally conquered by a certain Edmund Hillary and the affable Tenzing Norgay, the floodgates well and truly opened. The last eight-thousander to be climbed for the first time was Shishapangma Peak, in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter part of the 1900’s saw a number of successful ascents on the world’s highest peaks, owing to greater technology, advanced fitness regimes and established routes to the summits. However, for all the technology, these mighty peaks, in winter, withstood the onslaught of the human race. Slowly and steadily, humans found themselves on the top before February 26 (the designated date marking the end of the winter season) on 13 of the 14 eight-thousanders, with the most recent one being the successful summit of Pakistan’s infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/adventure-blog/2016/02/27/absolute-misery-climbers-complete-the-historic-first-winter-ascent-of-nanga-parbat-the-killer-mountain/&quot;&gt;Nanga Parbat (Naked Peak)&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. There are no prizes for guessing which is the last peak to remain. A number of mountaineers, including the legendary Reinhold Messner, deem the task “as close to impossible as it gets”. While the first summit of Mount Everest in winter was in as far back as 1980, an age where equipment could be considered archaic in comparison to today’s standards, K2 still remains unclimbed in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why K2 is a much more difficult climb than Mount Everest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might argue that if K2 was commercialised as heavily as Everest is today, we would see the mountain being conquered much more easily. However, this argument would fall flat in the face of the 26% fatality ratio of K2. One only has to look at the list of the people who have died on the mountain, and would easily notice that the list contains a number of accomplished and all the more celebrated climbers. What is more is that, the statistic of 1 in 4 deaths only includes those climbers who have summited K2 and does not include people who died on the mountain’s perilous slopes without summiting. If that was added, the statistic would look much more ominous, if it does not already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let’s come to the topography of the respective mountains in discussion, K2 and Everest. For starters, Everest Base Camp is relatively easier to get to, requiring only a few days trek from Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital. In comparison, one has to trek over 100 kilometres on dangerously steep country from the nearest village (Askole) to reach K2’s base camp, making it one of the most physically demanding hikes planet Earth has to offer. To provide further perspective and well, allure, the mountain is so remote that Pakistani locals never even bothered to name the mountain. It’s counterparts K1 (Masherbrum), K4 (Gasherbrum), K5 (Gasherbrum-II) and Broad Peak (Faichan Kangri) all had local names before the venture of the British, but not the then-unnamed Mount Godwin-Austen, owing to its unparalleled remoteness. Furthermore, K2 and the Karakoram house a much more unpredictable climate and harsher winds than the Himalayas. The easterlies that blow in from the Central Asian highlands are hindered in their journey by the Karakoram, which is located north-west of Nepal, thus significantly reducing their speeds before they reach the Himalayas. Owing to the same dangerously fickle weather, the Karakoram is more prone to avalanches, a sure sign of doom for any mountaineer, however experienced he or she might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the routes, Everest is usually climbed through either the North Face route or the South Col Route. The trails are so well established that many a climber has commented that he/she simply ‘walked upto the top’. Of course, there is the infamous Hillary Step and the Khumbu Icefall lower down, whose might is not to be underestimated, but these obstacles can be overcome with precise application of basic technicalities. However, K2 does not have as many twists and turns, which increases its ‘steepness’ by a considerable margin. As a result, an ascent of K2 requires skilful manoeuvring, something that cannot be expected of the fifty-year-old average Joe who eats chips and drinks cola thrice a day. In addition, if one is skilled, or rather lucky enough, to cross the lower areas of the mountain and successfully evades the ubiquitous avalanches along the way, one is confronted by the mighty ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_(K2)&quot;&gt;Bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;’, an outrageous couloir of overhanging ice seracs, which x-ray the climbers underneath and could topple at the slightest misstep. One can only hope and pray that one is not underneath a serac which surely will come hurtling down, sooner or later. Upon crossing the Bottleneck, one still has to climb a long distance as the summit still stands far away. This has given the mountain the reputation of having the ‘longest (summit) day’, despite the distance to be covered being roughly equal to the distance one has to cover on Everest’s summit day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, the fact that the mountain hasn’t been summitted yet in winter should come as no surprise. Mountaineers, both established and (informed) amateurs, regard K2 as the Holy Grail of Mountaineering, and the toughest assignment a climber could ever face in his lifetime. Therefore, if one were to complete this unlikely feat, they would have claimed one of the last remaining great prizes in mountaineering - the first winter ascent of the world’s second-highest mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece could come off as slightly disrespectful, towards Mount Everest in particular. However, that is not the case. It’s immense altitude still fazes many climbers, with more than 200 bodies on the mountain’s slopes being a testament to this fact. Despite the development and usage of brutal technology on Everest, the mountain still remains an incredibly difficult one to climb, particularly along the Eastern (Kangshung) face. The tragedy of 1996, an event narrated in ‘Into Thin Air’ by Jon Karakeur and adapted multiple times into the cultural arena, and the more recent 2015 earthquake in Nepal which took 18 lives, is justification of Sagarmatha’s eternal might. However, what is merely being contested through this write-up is that K2 receives the respect it deserves. And perhaps, on an arguably more aesthetic level, this article deals with how human nature is obsessed with only the best and the biggest whilst blatantly ignoring both the runners-up and the dark horse, be it whatever field. Needless to say, in this case, the best refers to Everest, with K2 donning the mantle of the classic ‘so-near-yet-so-far’ trope, in popular human perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as I write this, two simultaneous cross-cultural expeditions attempting to climb K2 in the 2019 winter have failed, with disputed reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To end with a little trivia, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat and potentially the isolated Kanchenjunga boast a higher ‘deadly’ rate, with Annapurna leading at 34% and also having seen the least number of ascents to date. However, the difficulty of attempting K2, much less summiting, is not up for debate at the ‘Elite Mountaineers’ Club’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even if your mate at the library does not fully appreciate the enormity of your achievement, you have managed to huff and puff your way into the Elite Mountaineers’ Club, er, I mean, the summit of K2.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aryaman Tewari</name></author><category term="sports" /><category term="extreme-sports" /><category term="headline" /><summary type="html">“In height, it may be second to Everest.

The Brexit enigma too often fails to become imminent to those outside Europe, resting in our peripheral vision. This is partly owed to the large amount of time that has passed since Britain ‘left’ the European Union, without actually having left the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even until the December 12 general elections, with the possibility (not probability) of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s victory, there were speculations regarding the future of the UK vis-a-vis leaving the EU. However, with the re-election of Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson as Prime Minister with an overwhelming majority, UK’s path to Brexit seems strikingly clear. In this environment, there is a need to clearly understand what has led to and what will potentially follow Brexit, hailed as possibly the most important moment in European history since the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of leaving the European Union has been on Britain’s mind from the moment it joined. Post Second World War tensions were high, and Britain’s economic growth was frightfully low. At the same time, in an attempt to ensure lasting peace, a few European states established the European Economic Community (EEC) hoping that economic interdependence would help avoid conflict. The EEC was a predecessor to the EU and surprisingly their old war ally Britain was not invited to the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in 1963, when the United Kingdom first applied for membership in the EEC, France’s President Charles de Gaulle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-europe-42165383&quot;&gt;vetoed its application&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that the UK would always be on America’s side, even as a part of the EEC. UK became a member only in 1973 and just two years later a national referendum was held on whether to leave the Common Market. 67% voted to stay. In 1993, under the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union was formed to integrate states economically and politically, and to establish a common citizenship, currency and unified foreign policy. The EU was not bereft of skirmishes. Some of these would quite literally be the epitome of ‘first-world problems’ such as petty trade barriers on commodities ranging from beef to chocolate. Others were more prominent, such as those regarding immigration and sharing the burden of the crisis surrounding the Euro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three overarching reasons that fuelled the ‘eurosceptic’ view and simultaneously drove the ‘Leave campaign’ in Britain were sovereignty, immigration and the Euro. British conservatives loathed the idea that the mighty United Kingdom must take orders from someone else. The growing power of the European Parliament, the ridiculous amount of red tape and the growing lack of autonomy were major causes of resentment against the EU. The economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent failure to deal with the flaws of the Euro made people not only in the UK but across the continent skeptical about the economic benefits of EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, what arguably had the most effect on the voters during the referendum was the free flow of people within the EU. Employment of locals posed one problem and a perceived relationship between immigration and crime posed another. The Migration Advisory Committee, however, in its review of the evidence of the labour market impact of EU migration, found that migrants have had little or no impact on the employment and unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should be noted is that EU states have a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; to restrict free movement. It was a decision made by Tony Blair’s government in 2003 that allowed full free movement, which is what led to an increase in immigration. Nevertheless, in the EU referendum campaign, the Leave campaigners pinned the surge of workers on the EU and not the British government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron promised a national referendum on European Union membership, convinced that ‘Remain’ camp would win handily. That turned out to be a serious miscalculation. The referendum passed by a slim 51.9% in favour of leaving. However, there were stark differences across the UK. Northern Ireland and London voted to remain in the EU, as did Scotland, leading to renewed calls for another referendum on Scottish independence. The rest of England and Wales, however, voted in favour of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three of Theresa May’s Brexit deals were rejected by the UK, she resigned, leaving Brexit to her successor Boris Johnson. As of December 20, 2019, Johnson succeeded in getting his Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) passed in the House of Commons, signaling the end of many years of political infighting regarding the issue. After the WAB becomes law, the withdrawal agreement also needs to be ratified by the European Parliament next month. Then the stage will be set for Brexit on January 31, when the post-Brexit transition period will begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 11 months, the UK will still follow all the EU’s rules and regulations, it will remain in the single market and the Customs Union, and the free movement of people will continue. The government and the EU will work out a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) for a smooth transition. Johnson has made it clear in the WAB that there will be no extension beyond 2020, and if no deal is worked out, then trade will carry on without agreement, meaning that tariffs would be levied on UK goods entering the EU and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WAB implies the following things. Firstly, the UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. Secondly, UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Those residing in an EU country for five years or more can apply for residency in said country. Thirdly, the UK will leave the EU Customs Union, which exempts members from tariffs and levies uniform tariffs on other countries. Leaving the Customs Union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future—although the exact extent of that freedom will only be revealed in the course of the trade talks with the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is the matter of how Johnson has dealt with the new ‘Irish question’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Ireland and its land border with the Republic of Ireland has posed a problem for Brexit for many years. Largely due to the ‘backstop’. The backstop was designed to ensure there would be no border posts or barriers between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Such posts would rekindle tensions and also serve as targets for potential insurgents groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new deal solves this problem by shifting these posts to the UK-Northern Ireland border instead. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ‘points of entry’ into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ‘at risk’ of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. The deal gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote on these new arrangements, but only four years after the end of the transition period, in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland opposes the WAB for leaving Northern Ireland behind and creating a situation where it must comply with EU customs laws even though it will be a part of the UK’s foreign trade deals. They advocate upholding the “economic and constitutional integrity of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrity of the Kingdom is further rattled by Scotland, which had expressed a 62% desire to remain with the EU in 2016. Although it does not seem economically viable for Scotland to unilaterally remain with the EU, Brexit gave impetus to the Scottish Nationalist Party, for whom all roads lead to Scottish independence. Even though they had voted ‘yes’ to maintaining union with the UK in 2014, the Scottish public opinion is still sharply divided (50:50). The Scottish government has proposed holding a second referendum on Scottish independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brexit is no longer a lulling stream but a whirlpool that is approaching quickly and with near-complete certainty. Although the UK may achieve external sovereignty, the integrity of its union may be deeply affected. On the other hand, a year does not seem nearly enough to undo 46 years of Common Market. Although Johnson is staunch on wrapping up Brexit in 2020, things are bound to overflow. The ‘remain’ votes in 2016 were dominated by the youth. Which leads us to think that by the time deals are made and debts are paid, those who inherit a ‘free’ and ‘independent’ UK, may not want it at all. However, where there is political will there is a way, as can be seen in Boris Johnson’s dogged eagerness. We really are then, at the end of an era.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ritisha Gupta</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">A globalized world means a lot of things, most of which is relegated to the back of our minds in the bustle of day-to-day life.

Another weekend where a powerhouse divisional champion hosts an underdog wildcard winner. On paper, this is exciting. The NFL playoffs are on a single-game format, so any team could end up making a historic run to the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it twice in recent history, the New York Giants were an underdog team and ended up dethroning the great Tom Brady. This is the type of storyline fans want to see every year. Unfortunately, this is not what we’ve come to expect from the wildcard weekend. Too many times we’ve seen a completely boring matchup between a team we expect to win, and a team we expect to lose, badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One matchup indicates the time of the wildcard is over, or at least on the path to being adjusted. The Philadelphia Eagles will be hosting the Seattle Seahawks on wildcard Sunday. You might be wondering why this matchup is so special. The powerhouse Seahawks are 11-5 on the season, while the Eagles are only 9-7. Why does a lesser team have the right to home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs? The answer is simple; divisional winners will always host a wildcard team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes total sense considering the divisional winner usually has a better record than the team they are hosting, but this isn’t the case for two teams this season. The Minnesota Vikings are 10-6 and the Seahawks are 11-5. Why should either of these teams be punished because of a terrible NFC East division? If either the Seahawks or the Vikings were in the NFC East, they would be hosting a wildcard team this weekend. While ‘fairness’ should be a factor in changing the rules, excitement is a better reason to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good football team like the Seahawks shouldn’t have to prove they can win on the road to a Philadelphia Eagles squad that barely snuck into the playoffs. It should be the other way around, as it has been in many of the NFL’s great underdog stories, with the unexpected team having to prove themselves. Watching the Eagles escape with a victory on CenturyLink Field in Seattle would create a much more exciting divisional matchup next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most people do not expect the Eagles to hold off the Seahawks, a string of injuries for both teams will make this game closer than originally expected. Going forward, the NFL should consider changing the seeding to reflect the standings rather than division winners. It is already a rare occurrence for a divisional winner to have a worse record than a wildcard so why not reward the better team?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday night’s matchup between the Seahawks and 49ers was exciting and meant the winner would go on to have a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. And the loser? The loser (the Seahawks) plays wildcard weekend on the road in Philadelphia. How does this make any sense? Why should the Seahawks end up playing on the road throughout the entire playoffs due to the lack of success in the NFC East? There isn’t really a good answer to either of these questions but there is a solution going forward; to eliminate divisional seeding all together and to have divisional records impact seeding based on the teams in each division. This would mean that two teams with identical records would be seeded based on their divisional records or games played between the two teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Sunday night game between the (at the time) 11-4 Seahawks and 12-3 49ers shouldn’t indicate who escapes the wildcard spot but rather who will have the home-field advantage. Yes, this would make season matchups less exciting, especially when so much was on the line in Sunday night’s game. However, this would alleviate the problem of lackluster conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is highly unlikely that a division has two Super Bowl contenders in the first place, but when it does happen, you better believe one of the teams will get screwed and end up on the road during the wildcard weekend. It’s time to stop rewarding poor divisions and teams with a free home game in the playoffs and start making them work even harder. While the season matchups could be affected by this rule change, the playoffs would be a lot more exciting, just like when Eli Manning led the lowly New York Giants on the road to a spectacular Super Bowl victory in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the 2011 Giants Super Bowl run had a similar storyline to 2019. The Giants played at home against a 10-6 Falcons team who were pushed into the wildcard by a better New Orleans Saints team in their division. Had the format been changed back then, Eli Manning might only have 1 Super Bowl championship but if he had ended up winning on the road again, it would have made for an even better story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the main reason the NFL would have for changing the playoff seeding. It is a sport and league rich with history and unbelievable stories, which shouldn’t allow an underachieving team to sneak into home-field advantage and ride that momentum to the Super Bowl. If the NFL ever does change this format, we could have many amazing underdog stories. Teams like the Seahawks wouldn’t be on the road for the first round of the playoffs while fans remain in disbelief that a 9-7 Eagles team is hosting wildcard weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do the problems begin and end at Manchester United?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjær on a full-time basis in March 2019, after a 3 month period in which he was greatly successful, epitomised the naivety and ineptitude of the United board. For whatever reason, the United board could not wait until the end of the season to take a more balanced, level-headed decision on the managerial appointment. The fans could be forgiven for believing that the initial honeymoon period which saw a huge upturn in results made Ole the right man for the job, but for the board to buy into this delirium exhibits an utter lack of prudence and shrewdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their haste to appoint the legendary former striker as manager, they took a risk which has backfired and the decision becomes ever more questionable and costly as each day passes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last season, when Jose Mourinho was relieved of his duties by Ed Woodward, he had accumulated 26 points from 17 games in the league. This campaign, Ole has managed 25 points in the same number of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manchester United have seemingly settled for mediocrity under Solskjær. In recent weeks, Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton have all fired their underperforming managers and replaced them. While United have dithered and dallied, Everton have been able to allure one of the most decorated managers in the world in Carlo Ancelotti, a man who surely would have been of interest to United.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If United were to sack Solskjær soon, Max Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino would be among the favourites to succeed the Norwegian. Ed Woodward and co. have long been admirers of former Spurs boss Pochettino, but they will have to act quickly if they wish to acquire his services. The Argentine has become one of the most sought after coaches in world football during the last few years and he will have no shortage of job offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hit and Miss Signings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signings have also been a sticking point of United’s in recent years. The £80m expended to obtain Harry Maguire was exorbitant, excessive and another example of United overpaying for a player. He’s undoubtedly one of the best centre-halves in the league, but his quality still fails to justify such an inflated fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexis Sanchez was another extortionate mistake, and while Fred has improved in recent weeks, the Brazilian is yet another player who has failed to vindicate such a large price tag. Meanwhile, defenders Diogo Dalot and Eric Bailly have failed to flourish and have subsequently fallen out of favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youngsters Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have been better signings, but both are still raw and will take time to develop into the class of player that United were previously famed for. They would also both benefit from competition for their places; ironically, they are more nailed on to start for Manchester United than they were at their respective previous clubs, Swansea City and Crystal Palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back even further, the acquisitions of Wilfried Zaha and Memphis Depay perhaps came too early in their careers. Both have gone on to forge formidable reputations for themselves and proven that the Red Devils should have remained patient with them when they didn’t immediately thrive at such young ages. The star quality they possess certainly wouldn’t go amiss at United at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacking a Playmaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has been made of the fact that the Red Devils struggle to break down opposition teams who sit deep. United are bereft of ideas when facing low blocks; they are crying out for a playmaker who can control the tempo of games and break teams down with line-breaking passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In games which tend to be more open, typically against higher quality opposition, United have enjoyed more success. They have the benefit of being able to utilise the lightning quick pace of Rashford, Martial and James, enabling them to be menacing on the break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one damning statistic which proves this notion. United currently lie in 6th place, and they have amassed 13 points from the 5 teams that sit above them, but just 12 points from the teams below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With recent victories over Spurs and rivals City, Ole has bought himself more time to prove to the Old Trafford faithful that he’s got what it takes to be successful in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Solskjær is bringing the best out of Marcus Rashford this year. The 22-year-old is in sumptuous form, enjoying his best goal scoring season to date. This is perhaps one reason that the United hierarchy have no plans to sack their manager anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for sticking with the Norweigian is stability. Stability is vital for any football club and group of players, and a club who had the same manager for 26 years prior to 2013 know that better than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the reasons outlined above, United’s decay is not entirely the fault of the former Molde manager. He is struggling with an incompetent board and an imbalanced squad, but questions remain over whether Ole has the managerial experience and tactical acumen needed to prevail at the biggest club in England. With long-term managerial target Mauricio Pochettino currently out of a job, it would make sense for Ed Woodward to try to entice Pochettino towards Carrington.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ali Abdi</name></author><category term="sports" /><category term="football" /><category term="headline" /><summary type="html">Since being appointed as permanent Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s win rate in the Premier League is just 32%, a figure meagre enough for any manager to get sacked, let alone one of a club who are so accustomed to glory.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Labour’s Tale of Woe: Reflections on the British General Election</title><link href="/Labour-s-Tale-of-Woe-Reflections-on-the-British-General-Election" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Labour's Tale of Woe: Reflections on the British General Election" /><published>2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Labour-s-Tale-of-Woe-Reflections-on-the-British-General-Election</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Labour-s-Tale-of-Woe-Reflections-on-the-British-General-Election">&lt;p&gt;In last Thursday’s British general election, the Conservative Party won a resounding majority of 356 seats to Labour’s 203, in what proved to be the Labour Party’s worst election defeat since 1935. The Conservatives saw significant gains in Britain’s Leave-voting constituencies in the North East and the Midlands, as Boris Johnson’s promise to ‘get Brexit done’ clearly resonated with many voters in traditional Labour strongholds. The certainty of an exit from the EU, coupled with the SNP gaining 13 seats in Scotland including that of the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, has also left many contemplating the future of the Union and the probability of a Scottish secession. But the most striking aspect of the election was the collapse of the Labour Party, which lost 59 seats from their 2017 results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson, in pledging not only to deliver Brexit but to increase public expenditure by £13.4 billion in 2020–2021, which would be the largest increase in spending in 15 years, clearly provided a theoretical break from the austerity policies and supply-side economics which had characterised the Conservatives’ previous administrations in the wake of the Financial Crisis, enabling him to win over voters in Labour strongholds. It is unclear, however, if this ‘One-Nation Conservative’ rhetoric will translate into policy, as Boris Johnson has voted consistently in favour of austerity policies since being returned as an MP in 2015. Moreover, it is entirely probable that having won a demonstrable majority, the Conservatives may use their relative unaccountability to continue the same cuts to income tax and spending that they were previously committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Labour, a schism between the Europhile, metropolitan, London-centric PLP and the Eurosceptic so-called ‘Red Wall’ of Northern, working class seats was the main source of their undoing. Labour lost 10.4% of the vote share in seats where 60% or more people voted Leave, as seats such as Sedgefield, Bolsover and Workington fell to the Conservatives. Dennis Skinner, a veteran Labour MP and former miner, lost his Bolsover seat after 49 years in Parliament. In 2017, when Labour had promised to honour the result of the referendum, they held 72 of the 100 constituencies in the most working class (C2DE) households. In 2019, this figure fell to 53, and the Conservatives increased their share from 13 to 31. Labour’s decision to cleave towards the centre to placate the Blairite elements of the Party was, therefore, an unmitigated catastrophe. Ian Lavery MP, who held onto his seat in Wansbeck in Northumberland by an unfathomably slender majority of just 800 votes, stated: “Ignore democracy and to be quite honest the consequences will come back and bite you up the backside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many voters in the aforementioned deindustrialised Northern towns now beset by a dismal combination of unemployment and precarious, low-wage service sector work, the fact that Labour had failed to completely acknowledge their Eurosceptic stance eroded their faith in democracy. Devoid for the most part of media influence or capital, the vote was the only way of making their voices heard. Having been neglected by a London-centric party and a political consensus dominated for decades by financialisation, the City of London and an obsession with GDP as the sole indicator of the prosperity of the nation, they struck a lethal blow against those who purported but failed to represent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perception of Jeremy Corbyn as an inadequate leader was another prevalent theme both on the doorstep and in mainstream political coverage throughout the election. Media coverage of Corbyn was relentlessly brutal. The virulent anti-Corbyn rhetoric even predated the election, as during the past 3 years, he has been referred to as a Czech spy, a Russian agent, an anti-semite and a Communist. It is undeniable that there are antisemitic elements within the Labour Party that Corbyn has been indecisive in removing, and that the British Left has a long and disgraceful history of indulging antisemitism, aptly described by August Bebel as “the socialism of fools”. Keir Hardie, the first ever Labour leader, blamed Jewish financial houses for the outbreak of the First World War. However, Corbyn himself has a long and understated history of opposing antisemitism. As far back as 1977, for example, Corbyn organised a counter-demonstration in defence of London’s Jewish community against 1,000 National Front members who attempted to march through Wood Green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blairites and moderate voices within the Labour movement continue to portray this election as proof that it is left wing policies that are unpopular rather than the party’s Brexit stance and alienation of its core voting bloc. They suggest that the Labour Party must revert to a pro-corporate ideology, being at ease with privatisation, marketisation and a bellicose foreign policy. Yet this is directly contradicted by the available evidence: a 2017 YouGov poll found that 60% of the British public support renationalising the railways, 59% support taking water into public ownership, and 53% supported public ownership of the energy companies. 60% also back higher levels of taxation and spending. To argue that the statistical success of Tony Blair compared to Jeremy Corbyn represents a necessity to return to a Blairite brand of politics is to misunderstand that the political context has changed significantly since 1997. A global financial crash, the longest squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic Wars, and house prices rising to 7.8 times the amount of annual salaries demonstrate that a significantly greater amount of fiscal intervention is required to alleviate the crises of the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technocratic, Blairite conception of politics, which focuses entirely on winning power for its own sake and ignores the broader contexts in which new political and economic ideas come to the fore, has subsided. It has been proposed, therefore, that the future of the Labour Party is a combination of a culturally conservative, patriotic communitarianism with economic leftism of the kind espoused by figures such as Clement Attlee and George Lansbury. The resurgence of ‘Blue Labour’ attests to this. However, it must be acknowledged that Labour is a party that, for decades, has attempted to straddle a coalition of voters with fundamentally different outlooks and views of the world that may be considered irreconcilable. Socially-liberal graduates in Manchester and London, harbouring an instinctual aversion to the monarchy and the nation-state, on whom the Labour Party also depends, would be alienated by such a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reconnect with its core vote, and to pull together its fractured coalition of voters, Labour will need a sustained and coordinated presence within areas of the country which perceive them to be London-centric and elitist, rather than merely turning up a week prior to the election and expecting votes. The neoliberal atomisation and individualism which characterise the present political era have torn asunder many community institutions which once fostered political dialogue and enabled people to become involved with politics. Therefore, much of the impetus must come from the grassroots elements of the party, with a priority placed on engaging in programmes such as the National Food Service and serving the concerns of local residents regarding ordinary issues such as education, housing and healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the schisms and fissures within the Labour Party, and between the party and the electorate have been destructive and have led to the party’s near annihilation. There is a significant amount of soul-searching to be done, as the Labour Party desperately attempts to avoid decades in political oblivion. Reconnection with the party’s Northern heartlands will be a clear priority, as will grassroots level organising and education. But some of these ideological vicissitudes, such as the gap between voters in the Northern heartlands and those in the major cities, run so deep that it is difficult to see the party recovering from them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Perrett</name></author><category term="society" /><summary type="html">In last Thursday’s British general election, the Conservative Party won a resounding majority of 356 seats to Labour’s 203, in what proved to be the Labour Party’s worst election defeat since 1935.

The purported goal is to provide a safe haven in India for persecuted religious minorities from other countries. However, hidden beneath the sophisticated wording of the Act lies a nefarious intention, one which has not gone unnoticed, thanks be to God. You see, although the proponents of this legislation speak with great orchestrated zeal about the need to welcome people from the vicinity of South-East Asia, the Act actually covers only three of India’s neighbours: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. All of these three are – notice! – Islamic countries. Other neighbours such as Nepal, China, Myanmar and Sri Lanka are very quietly left out, despite the fact that there is strong evidence of religious minorities experiencing persecution in many of these countries, the Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar and the Tamil Hindus of Sri Lanka being two prominent examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This careful (and obviously deliberate) exclusion is itself suspicious and meritorious of outrage and protest, but it gets even worse. Even with the inclusion of these three nations mentioned in the Act, only six religious communities are actually offered refuge: Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Zoroastrians and Christians. If you notice, there is one community that is left out: Islam, despite the fact that the Ahmadiyya and Shia communities – both of which identify very strongly as Muslim and have a significant following in these areas – are sometimes just as marginalized and persecuted as Hindus and Buddhists, if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this Act effectively results in is a horrendous state of affairs that would have scandalized the founding fathers of the modern Indian Republic. For the very first time in our history, citizenship is being offered in a special and expedited manner to members from some religious communities and not others, in clear contravention of the right to equality enshrined in the Indian Constitution, which has been held by the Indian Supreme Court to apply to all and not just Indian citizens. Perhaps if no Muslims in the neighbouring countries were being persecuted on religious grounds, this Act could have been justified. But there are Muslims being persecuted on the basis of their beliefs – quite a lot of them actually! – and this law silently excludes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of this law have argued that although certain Muslim communities are indeed marginalized in these lands, these are ultimately inter-sectarian disputes and therefore not nearly as grave a divide as the inter-religious schisms. However, this is patently false. There are quite a few Muslim fundamentalists who are of the opinion, for example, that Ahmadis are not a competing sect of Islam, but rather are entirely outside the fold of Islam. If you want evidence of this, see an example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMunEdtjqJ0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of extreme anti-Ahmadi rhetoric by an ultra-conservative Sunni. This has also spilled out into the political sphere. In 1984, an amendment was passed in Pakistan which prohibited Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslim or from posing as Muslims, a crime which was punishable by three years in prison!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, one might ask what the need was to selectively mention religious communities in the Act. Why not simply offer refuge to anyone who has been persecuted on the grounds of his/her religious belief? What difference does it make whether he/she is an adherent of an ancient faith like Hinduism or a community founded five years ago? Religious persecution is religious persecution, regardless of which faith or community we are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Indian government is adamant. The Indian Home Minister Amit Shah insists that no Muslims are persecuted in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh on religious grounds. &lt;em&gt;This is manifestly false&lt;/em&gt; (as I mentioned earlier), but suppose for a moment (for the sake of argument) that it is true. Even then, this still leaves an important question unanswered: why are other neighbouring states left out? Why not talk about Myanmar and the Rohingya community who have suffered so terribly at the hands of fundamentalists? Why include Bangladeshi Hindus and ignore Burmese Muslims. India’s government insists that they are not anti-Muslim, but their acts (as well as the words of many of their leaders) suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, however, the country has not stayed silent on this issue. India has, quite literally erupted in protest. Be it &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/delhi-anti-caa-protesters-set-fire-on-bbuses-jamia-millia-islamia-students-blamed/videoshow/72683068.cms&quot;&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cab-protest-violent-protests-west-bengal-buses-railway-station-torched-1628289-2019-12-14&quot;&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/anti-caa-stir-mob-torches-police-post-and-bikes-in-patna/articleshow/72696682.cms&quot;&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livemint.com/news/india/protests-hit-the-streets-against-cab-in-hyderabad-11576412081945.html&quot;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/citizenship-bill-why-is-assam-protesting/articleshow/72483294.cms&quot;&gt;North East&lt;/a&gt; of India, thousands are coming out onto the streets to oppose this discriminatory legislation, though not always for the same reasons. Almost every opposition party – including the right-wing former BJP ally Shiv Sena – has voiced its disapproval. And in many cases, protests have turned violent. Obviously, I condemn any form of unlawful violence, but I do not think it can be reasonably denied that the BJP government is responsible for passing a bill that has angered and divided large sections of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a situation of unprecedented public unrest, the right thing for the government to do is halt all legislation and seek dialogue with the protesters. After all, India is still – at least in theory – a democratic country in which the government is directly accountable to the people. However, this is not happening. Rather, the authorities have seen fit to resort to seemingly totalitarian measures in an attempt to suppress public dissent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/assam-cab-protests-internet-shutdown-december-16-2148819&quot;&gt;The internet was shut down in Assam for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news18.com/news/tech/citizenship-act-protests-internet-shutdown-in-aligarh-meerut-and-west-bengal-2425545.html&quot;&gt;in parts of West Bengal as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://scroll.in/latest/946906/citizenship-act-protestors-clash-with-police-in-delhi-buses-set-on-fire&quot;&gt;Delhi police stormed the campus of Jamia Milia University&lt;/a&gt; on the night of December 15, firing live rounds on students and tear gas shells in the university library, giving us scenes from an Orwellian novel rather than a constitutional democracy. A female journalist from the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; reported being the target of male law officers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/citizenship-amendment-act-protest-jamia-millia-islamia-students-journalist-attacked-delhi-police-1628500-2019-12-15&quot;&gt;her hair was pulled, she was beaten and her phone was broken&lt;/a&gt;. These are but a few examples of public vandalism and violence perpetrated by the very people tasked with maintaining law and order. In short, the country is in flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue has not gone unnoticed by the international community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://thewire.in/rights/united-nations-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-cab&quot;&gt;The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights &lt;/a&gt; has criticised the Indian government over the “fundamentally discriminatory” nature of the law. The United States Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cab-passed-in-ls-federal-us-commission-seeks-american-sanctions-against-amit-shah/videoshow/72450703.cms&quot;&gt;even sought sanctions against the Home Minister Amit Shah&lt;/a&gt;. The Act has also drawn strong (though perhaps hypocritical) criticism from both &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-strongly-condemns-citizenship-amendment-bill/videoshow/72452874.cms&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/india/video/bangladesh-hits-out-at-india-after-parliament-passes-cab-1627664-2019-12-12&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. In all of this, my heart goes out especially to the Ahmadi community. They are perhaps the most peaceful religious denomination that self-identifies as Muslim, and yet they are subject to horrific persecution. Shias still have a safe haven in Iran, but Ahmadis literally have nowhere to go in the Islamic world. The exclusion of Ahmadis from the Act is bizarre and barbaric. But it only serves to show the regressive mindset of the current government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indians need to wake up and realize that this is not at all a harmless piece of legislation. This may well be the first step to a &lt;em&gt;‘Hindu Rashtra’&lt;/em&gt; or ‘Hindu Country’. This is a frightening prospect; for centuries India has been a land of religious tolerance and cultural pluralism. Any attempt to homogenise the country is a direct assault not merely on its Constitution but on the very spirit of what it means to be Indian. As an Indian, I think it is incumbent upon every one of us to take a strong stand against this exclusionary bill and to resist this attempted move towards what truly seems to look like fascism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>anonymous</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="conscience" /><summary type="html">The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 of the Parliament of India, which received Presidential assent on December 12, has a stated objective that appears upon first glance to be rather innocent.

Here’s How." /><published>2019-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/Atheism-Destroys</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Atheism-Destroys">&lt;p&gt;It might sound strange to say that atheism destroys science. Indeed, many will laugh merely upon reading the heading of this article. However, my interactions with sceptics and postmodernists have convinced me that while it may seem to many that atheism leads to science and moral progress, the truth is exactly the opposite. Rather than upholding science, atheism destroys the foundations that underlie science; and far from promoting human progress, atheism degrades humanity and inevitably leads to moral decay in society. Not only that, I am also deeply convinced that a postmodernist attitude is simply the result of centuries of atheist influence upon the West; a true atheist will, in my opinion, adopt a postmodern outlook sooner or later. In this article, I hope to show why I think this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am a Christian, let’s talk about Christianity for a moment. As the Oxford mathematician and Christian thinker John Lennox has remarked multiple times, many of the scientists of the early Modern era were Christians because their faith in God led them to expect order and stability in the universe. Indeed, many of the very people who laid the foundations of science in the post-Reformation West were devoutly Christian people, believing that the study of the creation was a kind of worship to God. Indeed, that is my own opinion as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Christian, I believe that God gave us rationality so that we could use it to study and learn more about the world in which we live. My belief that my mind and my sense organs are a gift of God gives me sufficient ground to trust it as being reliable in giving me information about this wonderful universe which we are privileged to call home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an atheist cannot say the same thing. For suppose that we live in a world that is merely a cosmic accident, and suppose – for the sake of argument – that the material reality is all that exists and there is no spiritual dimension whatsoever. Under this view, the mind is purely a material phenomenon and is directly equivalent to the brain. There is no aspect whatsoever to the mind that is immaterial under this view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the brain is merely a conglomeration of nerves and chemicals. In a purely physical, materialistic world, what we perceive as emotions, thoughts and feelings are merely the result of chemicals firing around in our brain. Even our deepest moral sentiments are simply the products of how our brain has been evolved to think and perceive reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if this is true, then how can the atheist say that his senses and rational powers are capable of giving him an accurate depiction of reality? If the mind is simply a physical organ that is determined to function and act in a particular way (because of the evolutionary path that it happened to take), then there are no rational grounds for trusting your perception or your ability to reason. After all, everything – in an atheistic worldview – is a cosmic accident and the way your brain thinks and perceives something to be ‘rational’ or ‘logical’ or ‘reasonable’ is merely an accident as well. If evolution had taken a different path, then your brain might not even have existed… or it would have existed, but it would be operating in a different manner, giving you a different perception of what you call ‘reality’. But in that situation, you would have had radically different beliefs and ways of perceiving the world. What you today call ‘reasonable’ might under that circumstance appear absurd or farcical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that the atheist falls into a bit of a quandary. One alternative is that he can admit the fact and say that he simply ‘trusts’ his ability to reason and operates with that as his basic epistemological presupposition. But if this is so, then he cannot in good conscience criticize religious faith, since that too is a kind of trust in things we might not be able to “prove” with mathematical accuracy. Another alternative is that he can admit the fact I have mentioned and collapse into a kind of postmodernism, looking at all things – science included! – with scepticism, since even scientific observations are dependant upon human perception, which cannot be ‘proven’ per se to be reliable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if we were living in the Matrix, chances are we wouldn’t know that we were!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing holds true for morality. We all – atheists and Christians included – have basic moral instincts. From a Christian point of view, I believe that God is perfect and he gives us a basic knowledge of what is right and wrong. Thus, as a Christian, I can say with conviction that certain things are basically right and others are basically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can the atheist say such a thing? Certainly, atheists have moral beliefs, but can they justify those beliefs? After all, if there is no God and if materialistic naturalism is true, then there are no objective moral principles. Whatever morality we might have is purely subjective. Our mind is conditioned to think in a particular way – morally speaking - because of external accidental circumstances. Morality, in an atheistic worldview, inevitably becomes either a psychological construct or a societal one. On the former view, it is primarily evolution that conforms us to have certain moral instincts – and, remember, there is no guarantee that evolution would have taken the path it ultimately took! On the latter view, morality is primarily the result of societal conditioning – we happen to live in a society that values liberty and freedom; therefore, we have learned to value them as well. Had we lived in a cannibalistic society we would have had different moral values. This is called the doctrine of Cultural Relativism, and in this philosophy, no particular moral code is intrinsically superior to another, since they are all cultural constructs and all cultures are equally true and equally false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that atheists don’t have a sense of morality – they certainly do. The problem, rather, is that their metaphysical worldview cripples them from having an objective foundation for their morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is heart-breaking for me as a Christian to see prominent thinkers and philosophers encourage people to embrace a worldview in which everything is fundamentally meaningless and to “get used to it” (quoting Dr Susan Blackwood in her dialogue with Professor Jordan Peterson on the &lt;em&gt;Unbelievable?&lt;/em&gt; radio podcast). It is just as upsetting to see the rise of postmodern thinking in our world. I am convinced that such a mode of looking at the world will inevitably give birth to a society of depression and despair. And this observation vindicates my deeply Christian belief that only God can give true meaning and value to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People might find it similarly shocking that I claim atheism degrades human beings. After all, don’t many atheists identify as ‘humanists’? Don’t so many atheists fight so vigorously for human rights and don’t humanists try and oppose oppression around the world? An atheist friend of mine once quipped to me that the modern West is proof that we can have morality without God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t disagree more. And here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give one example: most atheists don’t, as far as I know, fight for the rights of the unborn. In fact, prominent atheists like Sam Harris complain that religious bigots such as myself still try to stop embryonic stem cell research. Similarly, I have never heard an atheist oppose the recent legislations that have effectively allowed the monstrosity of late-term abortions in New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not only the unborn who are being marginalized. Peter Singer, a prominent atheist ethicist, openly declares that – like unborn foetuses – new-born infants similarly lack what he calls the essential characteristics of personhood. The troubling implications of such a horrendous line of thinking are so alarming that words fail to convey the emotions that stir up in my heart as I write this article. And what is even more scandalous is that Singer is a vegan, although – as he would put it – a ‘flexible vegan’. In other words, he goes to great lengths to ensure that cows and buffaloes don’t suffer because of him… but that same privilege is not extended even to new-born babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing. I believe that deep down, everyone has a sense of right and wrong. And this sense has been given to them by God. If you want proof that a Divine Law does indeed exist, then turn to your own conscience. I believe that deep down, everyone knows that good and evil are real, but over time they manufacture philosophies and ideologies to rationalise away what they do not want to be true. Because if there is a Divine Law, you are not ‘free’ to enjoy things that are evil, however attractive or pleasurable that might be. And if there is a Divine Law, there must also be a Divine Law-giver before whom we are all accountable for our actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that you can’t be good without fear of punishment. On the contrary, I believe that the good should be sought for its own sake, rather than merely out of servile fear. Rather, what I am saying is that if there is no God, then good and evil are both illusions and have no real existence. And if that is so, then everything is permitted, since all things are then morally equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the disastrous implications of the revolution that our world has initiated against God. And you will then forgive me when I say that atheism is not a boon. It is, in fact, poison.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Soham Gupta</name></author><category term="society" /><summary type="html">It might sound strange to say that atheism destroys science.

Families want their sons to settle there and their daughters to marry the rich non-resident Indians. ‘&lt;em&gt;Caneda&lt;/em&gt;’ is a household term and a second home for these Punjabis. The rate of migration is such that Punjabis in Canada form roughly 2% of the total population, with a majority of them being Sikh. Punjabi is the third-most spoken language in Canada, after English and French. For the rest of us in India, it only seems fair to imagine a day when &lt;em&gt;Caneda&lt;/em&gt;’s Prime Minister is also a Sikh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the broader picture of Indo-Canadian relations shows a little more animosity between the two countries. The two countries share various complementarities, like their democratic character and association with the Commonwealth. Despite this and both countries recognising the economic potential in their bilateral ties, the relationship has been rather tense on the political front and thus has not prospered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major factor for this has been the activities of the Khalistan supporters in Canada. Canada’s criticism of India has also been responsible for denting India’s interest in engaging with Canada as a strategic partner. These criticisms have involved past events such as the military action in Amritsar’s Golden Temple and the 1984 riots. Relations reached one of their lowest points in 1985, when Sikh extremists blew up Air India Flight 182 as it left Vancouver Airport for India, killing all 329 passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these issues, the current political scenario of Canada has also caused some concern for India. Because of the prominent involvement of Sikhs in Canada’s politics and the regionalisation of Indo-Canadian politics, issues affecting the Sikh diaspora have often become a part of the political discourse in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While moderates view India favourably and oppose secessionist sentiments, the fundamentalist groups, such as the Babbar Khalsa, vehemently advocate for the Khalistan cause. Events like the 1984 riots and the Golden Temple incident have been frequently introduced in Canada’s provincial legislatures, often in the form of petitions. In 2010, for instance, Liberal MPs Sukh Dhaliwal and Andrew Kania introduced a petition in the House of Commons asking Canada to consider the 1984 riots as an act of genocide and discuss the issue with India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Trudeau has often been caught in the crossfire between pandering to the Sikh population in his country and maintaining peaceful relations with India. Canadian politicians tread a fine line when attempting to involve themselves in the Sikh community, ensuring that people do not see them advocating for separatist causes inadvertently. The Sikhs in Canada form a voting bloc for Trudeau. In April 2019, his government removed a reference to Sikh extremism from a report that had earlier termed Sikh terrorism as one of the five threats facing Canada. He even attended a Khalsa Day parade organized by a radical Gurudwara in Toronto in 2017 where people waved Khalistani flags and put images of Sikh separatist leaders and militants on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada cannot curtail the right to freedom of speech and expression of its Sikh citizens, but New Delhi wants Trudeau to distance himself from Sikh separatists, publicly. PM Narendra Modi clarified that India would not tolerate any attempts to undermine India’s sovereignty and unity in his press conference with Trudeau. Punjab’s Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh has publicly accused Trudeau’s ministers of having sympathies with Canadian Sikh extremists and secessionists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18 Sikhs were voted into the 338-seat lower house of the Canadian Parliament in the 2019 Federal Elections. However, only 13 candidates from the Sikh community were elected to the 543-seat Lok Sabha in the 17th General Elections in India. Sikhs form approximately 2% of the population both in Canada and India, but their representation in politics is unmatched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of these 18 Sikhs is the leader of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh. A former criminal lawyer, Singh created political history in Canada when he made his debut in the House of Commons as the first non-white leader of a major opposition party in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-election polls showed he was the most popular of the three party leaders. Singh is your poster woke boy with swag. Recognised in Canadian media for his fashion sense and style, Singh identifies as a progressive and a social democrat. He supports a progressive tax system and a $15 per hour minimum wage. He strongly advocates for equality, and supports LGBTQ rights. He also wants to save the planet by reducing the carbon emissions levels of Canada to 30% of 2005 levels by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada’s highly decentralised federation, forming the government at the provincial level makes the NDP an influential political force. Being led federally by a “visible minority” makes it a prominent symbol of the maturity of Canada’s multiculturalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Democratic Party, despite winning only 24 seats in the 2019 General Elections, has become one of the most talked-about parties. We can attribute two key factors to this popularity: (i) Singh’s speech in the democratic debate and (ii) the Liberal Party emerged as a minority party in the elections. Despite the Liberal Party staying a minority party in the House of Commons, forming a coalition with the NDP to govern, as the majority party, had been a general suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canadian media refer to Singh as the “kingmaker” in the legislative. The Liberal Party would need NDP’s votes on issues where the NDP and Liberals are more aligned than the Conservatives are, to pass any bill. For India, its interest in Singh is not one of pride that an Indian rose to become the leader of a major political party in a powerful Western state. Instead, the power Singh holds having entered the Canadian parliament has become a matter of concern for India. He has had a history of defending militants fighting for a separate Sikh homeland and lobbying for labeling a 1984 pogrom against Sikhs in India a ‘genocide’ by the government of Ontario. While he has not offered unqualified support to the Khalistan cause and remains vague on the issue, he has criticised India for Operation Blue Star. Singh will now have a far more consequential platform to continue his activism concerning attempting to seek justice for several violent episodes in India’s past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, India denied Jagmeet Singh a visa to visit because he was “misusing the pretext of human rights to pursue his insidious agenda of disturbing the social fabric of India and undermining the peace, harmony and territorial integrity of India.” For a provincial politician, this is notable. But as the leader of a major political party with a seat in the country’s main legislative body, this suspicion towards Singh by a friendly country is of more substantial potential consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has dealt with a partition once before and thus has little tolerance for movements that could threaten further division of the state. This and the fact that India comprises culturally distinct regions make its current integrity reliant on a compact of pluralism. Khalistan seems to have more significant traction in the Sikh diaspora than it does in Punjab. Because of which India seems more concerned about diaspora movements that agitate for its creation than internal movements. Thus, India is sensitive towards anything that it perceives as a threat to its unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Singh is leading a deeply divided party that is facing severe fundraising deficits and a significant number of experienced MPs who won’t be seeking re-election. If he wishes to use his new platform to bring light to the injustices of India in the 1980’s, Singh would have to wait until he has dealt with the more direct concerns of his party first. The primary focus of the realities of Singh’s role at home may just save New Delhi from having to be overly concerned with him for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devyani Arora</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">For many families in Punjab, shifting to Canada and being a permanent resident is the objective.

The visit was unprecedented, it was the first high-level trip from India to these nations. While India has hosted the Lithuanian Vice President, the Latvian President and Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Estonia in the past, there had been no reciprocal high-level visits until recently. It was only in 2016 when Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr Ravishankar Prasad visited Estonia. This visit corrected the imbalance between incoming and outgoing heads of states, sending out the message that India recognises the importance of the Baltic nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic nations have come a long way from the history of occupations, finally gaining independence in 1991. Today, they stand as global leaders in artificial intelligence, e-governance and e-security. Coming to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, India sees an organic alliance with these countries, thus, calling for outreach from the Indian side. Furthermore, China is fast increasing its footprint in the Baltic region in the setup of the ‘New Great Game,’ so, India has to step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign policy for Europe has concentrated only on Western Europe, with the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The Baltic outreach is a correction of this skewed worldview and a move to strengthen bilateral relations with small nations rather than treating them as subsets of their relationships with other big powers. The Vice President’s visit is expected to open more novel opportunities for cooperation in sectors discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral trade between India and Latvia stood at about US$141 million in 2015-16. Major Indian exports were tea, coffee, tools, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, garments, iron and steel. Indian imports majorly composed of chemicals, fertilizers, iron and steel, and machinery. In the case of Estonia, total bilateral trade in 2018-19 was US$172.53 million with machinery and equipment, garments, knitwear, coffee, tea, spices, footwear and pharmaceutical products as major export items. Imports from Estonia were mainly in iron and steel, fertilizers, electrical machinery, paper and paperboard, and paper pulp. Bilateral trade between India and Lithuania stood at about US$ 215 million in 2015-16. Major Indian exports to Lithuania included vegetable saps and extracts, fish fillets and other fish meat, medicaments, footwear, ferroalloys, carpets and rice. Lithuanian exports to India included mineral or chemical fertilizers, potassic, dried leguminous vegetables, wadding of textile materials, nickel waste and scrap, diagnostic or laboratory reagents on backing and machzone-therapy appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a scope for growth of textiles, agro-products, gems and jewellery, chemical dyes and pharmaceuticals exports to the Baltic nations. Import of technology would be an important area in the relationship between these nations and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, India is keenly pushing the International North-South Transport Corridor. This is meant to provide an alternative to the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal as a shorter route for the movement of trade through Central Asia and Russia. A major plus point of the project is that it will help Asian and European countries to transport their cargo at double the speed compared to the Suez Canal. This route can be expanded to connect Baltic, Nordic and Arctic regions and thus enhance connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvia’s ice-free Riga port connects the Baltic region with the rest of Europe, Russia and Central Asia. An agreement on this port can help Indian exports reach European markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is developing the “Rail Baltica” project under the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). This project connects cooperating member states to the Baltic nations with the existing European Rail network. This project aimed at taking the Baltic nations out of the Soviet shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-Security and IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia is a world leader in information technology, e-governance, cyber-security and innovation. The software developers from the country developed the code for Skype and Kazaa. The country is home to NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. In 2007, it became the first country to allow online voting in the general elections. High-tech industries now account for 15% of the country’s GDP. The Indian government and businesses are trying to come to terms with the disruption caused by artificial intelligence and big data. Deeper collaboration between Estonian and Indian businesses can reap benefits for both. The experiments with proxy voting and simultaneous polls would call for government-to-government collaboration and best practices from Estonia would come handy. An MoU for Cooperation in e-Governance and emerging digital technologies and Cooperation in Cyber Security has been signed in this regard. Lithuania sees an opportunity in Brexit and is fast emerging as a hub in Fintech. With the Fourth Industrial revolution, these bilateral relationships will become vital for India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania can be a strong technology partner in agro-processing and pharma, with expertise in dairy and cheese production. Agri-tech can help realise the vision of improving agricultural productivity hence, doubling farmer incomes by 2022 for India. It can help fuel growth in India’s food processing industry which is at a nascent stage with only 5% of the total production being processed. Laser technology has emerged as a strategic trade item from Lithuania to India, especially sought after by Indian universities and research centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have very high energy dependence on Russian gas pipelines, owing to their Soviet past. The European Union Climate and Energy Package has helped the Baltic Nations improve the energy security stance by increasing production from renewable sources of energy. Despite its shale oil reserves, Estonia is transitioning away from fossil fuels to biofuels, photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Estonia was the first European country to adopt electric and hybrid cars. It hosts big solar parks with a total capacity of 3GWh. The Baltic nation is planning to plunge into wind power, despite the shale reserves fulfilling 85% of the energy needs. Lithuania too is venturing into the renewable energy space through wind power and biomass (biogas and waste). The country aims to increase the share of renewables in its electricity mix to 23% by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the speed with which these nations are diversifying their energy needs, they can be useful partners in the International Solar Alliance started in Paris by PM Modi. They could play a vital role in enabling the rapid deployment of solar energy globally and facilitating technology transfer. Given high import dependency for its energy needs, India can facilitate study tours for officials for the transfer of best practices from these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education &amp;amp; Employment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been an increase in the number of outbound students to the Baltic Nations. According to data from the Indian embassy, 100 Indian students are currently studying in Latvia, 211 in Estonia and 600 in Lithuania. The main attraction is affordable education without compromising on the quality. Indian Vice President also lauded the e-residency scheme launched in 2014 by Estonia as “a launchpad for Indians in the Baltic, Nordic and European markets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite encouraging numbers, the mobility of students and the workforce is still below potential. Education fairs and awareness programmes are essential to tap the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian companies such as Indorama, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro and Bharat Forge have made investments in the region. Indian companies are being wooed by promoting this region as a cost-effective and productive destination with high research capabilities. An investment of US$200 million has been made by Indorama, a Lohia Group company in the Klaipeda Economic Zone in Lithuania on a plant to manufacture plastic resin. The Indian embassy and Assocham carried out ‘Make in India: Roadshow’ to promote India as an exciting investment location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Baltic regions have common linguistic roots and cultural similarities. For instance, Sanskrit and Lithuanian have around 10,000 words in common. The study of Indian languages (mainly Hindi and Sanskrit) is carried in Vilnius University at the Centre of Indian Studies, under the Department of Oriental Studies. The University of Tartu in Estonia began teaching Sanskrit in 1837. The Baltic nations have a great interest in Yoga and Ayurveda. The University of Latvia in collaboration with the Arya Vaidya Pharmacy, Coimbatore has been conducting a 3-month Diploma course in Introduction to Ayurveda since February 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation in Multilateral Forums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outreach to Baltic nations has helped India secure a non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council from 2021-22. These nations have also supported India as a permanent member in an enlarged and reformed UNSC. The support from small nations puts pressure on bigger nations to pay attention to the agenda of reforms. Besides, Estonia would have a non-permanent seat in the UNSC beginning from 2020. India and Estonia can support each other in the UNSC if bilateral relations see an upward trend. A seasoned diplomat noted that these nations can prove to be good interlocutors for India vis-a-vis the European Union. A bone of contention between India and the European Union has been the Comprehensive Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA), and Baltic nations can play a constructive role in negotiating that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the vibrancy of the partnership, it can be safely concluded that only sky’s the limit. Governmental support, availability of skilled labour, ease of doing business and a conducive environment are essential to realise the objectives of the partnership. Godspeed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gurleen Kaur</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">The Vice President of India, M Venkaiah Naidu visited the three Baltic nations: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from August 17-21, 2019.
