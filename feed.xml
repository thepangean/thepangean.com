Similarly, death seems to be a loss for the ones who die, at least in the human imagination, since the dead no longer exist for themselves or for others. In this context, death can be considered overwhelmingly ‘bad’ or harmful to human existence. So, if death is ‘bad’, then not dying must be ‘good’. Would this mean immortality is, in some ways, good because life itself is the essence of ‘goodness’ or the antithesis of death?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above exposition might be a common assumption where immortality seems desirable, we can answer the question posed above only if we have an accurate evaluation of what is actually good. This essay investigates the metaphysical nature of death and its moral implications only to argue that death is better than an immortal existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Defining Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals today command consensus over the scientific dogma that “human death is the irreversible cessation of the functioning of the brain including the brainstem”– as argued by Mr Thomas in the journal called &lt;em&gt;Bioethics&lt;/em&gt;. But there still exists a vibrancy of contentions that scholars often include in their respective theories of death. One school of thought considers death to be the inevitable end of a person’s existence, while another believes that only the body perishes on dying, for the soul lives forever. Deductions from the latter argument open doors for discussions on salvation, Heaven, Hell and the beyond. But, how much do we actually know about them for us to discuss them fruitfully? Great spiritual gratification may be found in death by those who believe in the latter, however, it is more convincing to approve of the former argument, given the limited knowledge we have about death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our current knowledge at least verifies a universal truth that death is the common fate of all human beings, post which they stop existing physically. There is no concrete evidence to support any concept of another life, an after-life, or a reincarnation, among other divine hypotheses. Though a few mythological and religious texts support supernatural theories like these, the scientific age has turned them down on grounds of insufficiency of rationale and absence of proof. Also, even if we were to agree that there is an aftermath to death, it is certainly devoid of one’s original identity, thus terminating that particular life anyhow. The seemingly eternal soul will find a new body to sustain in, and leave that too one day before finding another body for a cycle of death to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if we analyse only the knowledge we are certain of, it is easy to accept death as a state of individual non-existence and nothing more. Consequently, it is a permanent annihilation of a person (at least as we know him/her) from the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of Death: The Deprivation Account of Badness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophical discussions surrounding the nature of death – good or bad – has been in a constant argument among diverse schools of thought for several centuries now. My belief resonates with the ideas of deprivation theorists like Thomas Nagel and Shelly Kagan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deprivation Theory elucidates that death is bad because we can no longer experience the good things in life by virtue of our non-existence. When we cease to exist, we are naturally deprived of the good things in life. Therefore, being dead may not be intrinsically bad, but, it is relatively bad when compared to a situation that could allow us to continue watching the sunset, keep playing with our children and keep eating favorite delicacies, among other fortunes. Hence, the state of death makes us worse off than we were alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, some may argue that a person who was suffering when alive is better off once dead. He does not need to feel the pain and agony anymore. While the context of this argument may seem reasonable, even in this case we are worse off dead since we have no knowledge of what awaits us after death. For all we know, one might end up suffering to a greater extent than he already was when alive. A known devil is better than an unknown angel: we are better off being a part of what we know than walking into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second, stronger rebuttal can be drawn from the Epicurean argument that suggests we be indifferent to death. It explains that death cannot be good or bad since there is no existing person who can describe or value its pleasant or harmful nature. However, if an existing person were to be stripped of all the good things in his life, he would curse whoever did that. Similarly, if it were ever possible, he would curse death as well. Just because he exists no more is no reason for us to disregard the harm that death did to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a Roman philosopher named Lucretius offers yet another contention to my viewpoint. He believes that our non-existence after dying is just like the non-existence we underwent before birth. Since the latter is not bad, the former should not be bad either. To answer his claim, it can be expounded that our prenatal period did not involve any loss. On the contrary, death is a result of the loss of our life. Losing the good things in life is attached to a negative connotation. This way, we have proved yet again that death is a bad venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Mortal’s Assessment of Immortality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the introduction of this essay, I had questioned if life was a good thing, provided death is bad. Now that we have established “death is bad,” we must assess immortality to see what life actually is. In order for immortality to be good, says Bernard Williams, two conditions need to be met simultaneously: the ‘Attractiveness Condition’ and the ‘Identity Condition’. Therefore, in order for immortality to be bad, or worse than death, these two conditions must not get fulfilled simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attractiveness Condition requires a life to have attractive meaning forever. Imagine doing something you love for one month straight. Then a year. Then a decade. Then a century. Then millions and billions of years. Regardless of how much you love that experience inherently, it will eventually lose its attractiveness when done repeatedly over a significant length of time. Such repetition will only lead to boredom and monotony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, a counter-argument could be that an immortal person would have a diverse routine, doing everything immortally possible. So, let Monday be music day, Tuesday – singing day, Wednesday – travelling day, and so on… Furthermore, imagine the schedule changes every week with new activities every day. Still, how long before we exhaust doing the things we like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take the argument to an all new level, let us take Robert Nozick’s Experience Machine. Even if we were to feel a variety of pleasures, every single day of our lives, over and over again, ultimately all our desires would lose meaning, leaving nothing for us to live for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may also delay participating in activities that we were keen to be a part of when mortally alive. Immortality might swing us towards a ‘will-do-it-tomorrow’ attitude because our days are no longer numbered. The ambition that a finite life instills in us would be lost to the drudgery of time, hence compromising the attractiveness of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us also discuss the Identity Condition, which requires that our personality and uniqueness always stay intact. It is difficult to consciously fulfill this condition, given the human mind is easily prone to tedium and ennui. In order to prevent this, an immortal person could attempt to transform himself in a way that divests him of his real-self and creates an existential crisis. Such attempts could include a ‘removal of higher consciousness’ so as to become ignorant towards an unending life or ‘inducing mental forgetfulness’ so as to experience every activity as if it were the first time, even if it were the millionth. This would artificially preserve the attractiveness of life but compromise our true identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it can be concluded that the Attractiveness Condition and the Identity Condition cannot be met simultaneously because of a clearly presented dilemma: If we live forever as our true selves, boredom will eventually set in and life would not remain as attractive; and if boredom does not set in, then it is not our true self that is living immortally; in both ways making immortality bad or in fact worse than death. While a finite existence promotes ambition, passion, motivation, and determination, an infinite life endorses dispiritedness, indifference, and lethargy over time. The balance of nature makes sure an unnatural phenomenon like immortality is worse than the natural principle of death. In other words, it is verily because of death that life becomes good, and it is verily because of life that death becomes bad. It is this metaphysical dichotomy and the epistemic limitations to a true understanding of death which makes life better than death. But, at the same time, this is what makes an unending life valueless too, for, without death, life is, quite unironically, pointless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shivang Singh</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">It is basic human nature to mourn the death of our loved ones for they are no longer with us.

&lt;p&gt;Each new development comes at a cost. We frequently witness the dawn of a new era at the expense of the old, such as the Iron Age following the Bronze, which itself followed the Stone Age. The advent of the Industrial Revolution wiped out the livelihood of millions, such as cobblers and weavers who were forced to adapt or be left behind, and this dynamic process continues today, only now at a much faster rate. In this era of ‘The New Machine Age’, we enter a dramatical phase where even highly skilled jobs are at risk, and where there will be increasing technology and potentially decreasing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realities of the new Machine Age are becoming clear and we can use them to chart the challenging yet abundant economy that we are creating. According to research at Oxford University, almost one out of every two jobs has a high risk of being automated by machines. Machine Learning, the most powerful branch of Artificial Intelligence, is the technology which is to be blamed for this alarming disruption. It basically permits machines to learn from data and mimic some of the routine jobs that we humans perform, but much more efficiently. And, evidently, this can prove game-changing or extremely problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study from Forrester Research goes so far as to predict that 25 million jobs might disappear over the next decade. To put that in perspective, that is three times as many as jobs lost in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis. In fact, 87% of the lost manufacturing jobs have been eliminated as a result of improvements to our own productivity through automation. Automation is spreading to every production sector in every country around the globe. Output in the manufacturing sector in the US is actually growing, but we are losing jobs and lots of them. In fact, from 2000-2010, 5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost to machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the blue-collar jobs that are at risk, even those at the top of the ladder, including the highest-paid people, will be affected. What is clear that no matter whatever your job, at least some of it will be done by a robot in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that the reason why visionaries like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are talking about government-funded minimum income levels? By the time today’s elementary school students are college-aged, we could be living in a robotic world largely unemployed and stuck in an ‘ungreat depression’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is supplemented by the dangers of technological advancement beyond automation and job replacement. Consider the tasks that are now done by a phone. Navigating a strange city? Impossible without Google Maps. Can’t decide where to take your next trip? MakeMyTrip will tell me. No time to answer all my texts? Siri will do it for me. These “artificial brains” are modifying quickly from knowing me to representing me to being me. In fact, they are starting to become an e-copy of us—and if that thought is not yet disturbing, imagine the power of this digital human amplified 100x in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we give an AI programme the goal to make humans smile. When the AI is weak, it causes humans to smile by performing normal amusing actions. However, when the AI is super intelligent, it realises there is a more effective way to achieve this goal: take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins. Of course, while such a scenario sounds very alarmistic, it does highlight a fundamental problem. AI is a genie inside a bottle, so the only solution is to find a way that when it gets out, it is on our side through shared values. This does not involve spelling out a long list of what we care about in computer code, rather an AI could use its ‘intelligence’ to learn what we value. Because, after all, the real worry isn’t enmity, but competence. A superintelligent AI can attain its goals, however for the common good of the world, we need to ensure that its goals are aligned with ours. For instance, humans don’t generally hate bees, but we’re more intelligent than they are – so if humans want to build a home in the place of a beehive, too bad for the bees. The beneficial AI movement is simply a way of avoiding placing humanity in the position of those bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work that brings everyday surprise is designed for humans and not machines. And an area in which we are most certainly able to compete with and beat any machine conceivable is creativity. Machines have made very little progress in tackling novel situations. The fundamental limitation of Machine Learning is that it requires huge volumes of past data which we humans don’t require. We have the capability to connect seemingly disparate threads to find a solution to crisis situations or problems we have never seen before. The ability of the human mind to take strands from reality and weave them into something beautiful using a vivid imagination cannot be surpassed by bits of code, no matter how intelligent it is. Indeed, an AI programme has made music, but the capacities of such programmes have a critical limitation: they cannot do something new, which is the foundation of human creativity, they can only replicate and mutate the data that is given them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it would seem that, with the right kind of limitations on what Machine Learning is used for and an investment in human beings, we can really herald a society where man and AI work together. First, we need to change our educational institutions to help foster more and more creativity, thereby preparing the jobs market for a situation where humans no longer do many mundane jobs. The efficiencies created by this division of labour between humans and AI will reap rewards that can only be imagined. Second, we need to align AI with our value systems and morals, using it as a purposeful instrument for human betterment rather than as a sterile but disastrously potent machine. With these two broad approaches, we humans can reach even greater heights of civilisation in the coming Age. After all, to quote Max Tegmark, President of the Future of Life Institute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Everything we love about civilization is a product of intelligence, so amplifying our human intelligence with artificial intelligence has the potential of helping a civilization flourish like never before – as long as we manage to keep the technology beneficial.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>unnati.jain sailesh.buchasia</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">How can mankind prevail in the face of such exponential and encompassing technological change?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Has the Dragon Woken Up? A Look at China’s Arctic Policy</title><link href="/China-Arctic-Policy" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Has the Dragon Woken Up? A Look at China’s Arctic Policy" /><published>2019-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/China-Arctic-Policy</id><content type="html" xml:base="/China-Arctic-Policy">&lt;p&gt;The urge to control resources is as old as human civilisation. European travellers’ constant endeavour to find new trade routes with the Far East from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the establishment of European settlements and colonies in Asian and African countries are the best manifestations of this urge. Most of the twentieth century was marked by efforts of countries like America and the erstwhile USSR at increasing their military and economic sphere of influence. This lust continues even in the present century but, interestingly, new players have appeared on the horizon. The most notable of these is China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Arctic-Pie Everyone Wants a Slice Of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Control on land has reached, probably, its exhaustion limit. Space and water are new frontiers human beings are exploring. As a testimonial, one can take the example of the Arctic region. Besides littoral states — Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the United States, China, lacking even an Arctic coast, is asserting its right over the waters of the Arctic. Interest in the Arctic, which is a twenty-first century happening, has its roots in climate change. The region at present is characterised by thick white sheets of snow. It is pitch dark for half of the year and has bizarre ‘white nights’ for the remaining half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the deal: global warming is likely to lead to the melting of these snow sheets and, in turn, to the discovery of huge energy deposits. In 2008, the US Geological Survey released an assessment, and, according to it, the Arctic possesses 30% of the world’s undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its undiscovered oil reserves. In addition to this, the ocean would become navigable and shorter trade routes would ensure faster movement of ships when the snow caps melt. Analysts believe that, because of the melting snow, the ‘north-east passage’ will open-up towards Europe and the ‘north-west passage’ will ensure better connectivity between the USA and Canada. China’s Arctic ambition can be seen in the background of this hunt for resources and new trade routes, fuelled by its desire to be an important geopolitical player and an energy giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Chinese Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo, putting forth his country’s claim and questioning the territorial rights of littoral states said, “The Arctic belongs to all the people around the world, as no nation has sovereignty over it. . . . China must plan an indispensable role in Arctic exploration as we have one-fifth of the world’s population.” His remarks upended the international relations policy of China, which is embodied in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence rooted in respect for the sovereignty of nations. To support its argument, Beijing says that as per the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Arctic is a shipping commons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China and the Arctic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, China secured a permanent observer status in the Arctic Council, which many saw as a sign of growing Chinese influence in the region. The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum formed in 1996. Its members - Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States address issues of sustainable development and those faced by the indigenous people of the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, Beijing came up with a White Paper on Chinese Arctic Policy, the first official document on Arctic strategy. It explains the economic possibilities the region offers to the country and declares China to be a major stakeholder by labelling itself as a “near-Arctic State” even though Beijing is almost 3,000 km (1,800 miles) from the Arctic Circle. The document seeks Beijing’s close involvement in areas like scientific research, resource exploration, shipping and security. As per the White Paper, China wants to integrate the ‘Polar Silk Road’ or ‘blue economic passage’ with the greater Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former is a predominantly China-Russian partnership to link China and Europe through the Arctic Ocean. The Belt and Road Initiative is the brainchild of President Xi Jinping and aims to connect 152 countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa through vast logistics and transport networks. Many countries including India are sceptical about BRI as they see it as a veneer under which China wants to boost its own economic and political influence. China’s plans for a Polar Silk Road include developing Arctic shipping routes. It has bought or commissioned several ice-breakers - including nuclear-powered ones - to carve out new routes for its goods through the Arctic ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to allay the fear of countries which are sceptical about its intentions, China is courting countries of the region near the Arctic through diplomatic and economic initiatives. It is making investments in Greenland and wants access to its mines. The Chinese company Shenghe Resources purchased a 12.5% share in Greenland Minerals and Energy. Xiao Yang, director of the Arctic Research Center at Beijing International Studies University recently wrote in a paper, “Greenland will be the key node for the successful implementation of the Polar Silk Road.” Greenland is self-governing, though still nominally controlled by Denmark. And this Chinese move is worrying the Danes and the Americans too, as the latter has the vast Thule Air Base located in the far north of Greenland. In fact, in 2013, Iceland became the first European country to enter into a Free Trade Agreement with China. Chinese banks have made huge investments in Iceland after the 2008 crisis. The China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory in northern Iceland will conduct research on glaciology, oceanography and other similar fields. In addition, the state-owned China Development Bank has made a huge investment in the Russian energy company Novatek. It will provide China access to Arctic’s liquefied natural gas from the Yamal liquefied natural gas project in the northern port of Sabetta. The first cross-border railway bridge to link China and Russia was completed on April 2, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides diplomatic initiatives, China is spending more than $60 million annually on polar research. The China-Nordic Arctic Research Center has been set up in Shanghai. Until now, nine Arctic expeditions have been undertaken by China. The last one will make long-term atmospheric and oceanographic monitoring possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An insight into the Arctic policy of China makes one believe that diplomatic endeavours of Xi Jinping are moving in the right direction. The Second Belt and Road Forum in Beijing concluded on April 27 this year. China claims 150 countries participated in this forum, indicating Chinese prowess. Of course, India was a notable exception. As Napoleon famously aphorised about 170 years ago, “Let China sleep; when she wakes she will shake the world.” It seems the dragon is finally awake. It is difficult to underestimate the growing economic influence of China in the world and, in particular, the Arctic region―where its power grows in leaps and bounds. Only time will tell how successful it will be in camouflaging its ‘predatory economics’ with environmental monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Manya Manushi</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">The urge to control resources is as old as human civilisation.

fundamentally alter the way everyone functions, which includes the complete
disruption of many industries and their business models. Banking is one such
industry which has experienced major turmoil when it comes to digital services
and mechanisation. Every transaction, be it online shopping, foreign currency
exchange, stock investments, or money transfers, is possible digitally at our
fingertips. At the intersection of finance and technology lies this altering
phenomenon, Fintech, which has been accelerating the pace of change at a
remarkable rate and is reshaping the industry’s status quo. ‘Fintech’ is a term
that has become the new trend in the media and in technology circles. Yet,
despite being widely discussed, many – including tech-savvy and clued-up
entrepreneurs – don’t quite have a handle on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traditionally fintech was used for back-office functions to help banks
manage customer databases, facilitate transactions and record accounts, today it
has DIY modes where customers have a plethora of digital platforms at their
disposal, almost eliminating their dependence on a brick and mortar bank. With
24/7 device-sceptic access, virtually every transaction is now digitally
possible. The relevance of having several brick and mortar bank branches is
reducing as banking permeates all digital channels (cell phones, social and
online channels). According to some studies, in the European Union itself, more
than nine thousand bank branches were closed at the end of 2016 due to the wider
introduction of electronic payments and online/mobile banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Disruption: What next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy financial institutions looking to become digitally-enabled encounter two
main problems. First, the business models and personal skills that have been
imbibed in the industry for decades have been disrupted by digital innovation,
and no longer hold the same degree of importance in the new banking ecosystem.
Second is “the innovator’s dilemma”. The innovator’s dilemma implies that when
companies adopt new technology and allocate the resources accordingly, they end
up disrupting the existing methods, something which they were already nurturing.
Hence, they might prefer to focus resources on existing methods to avoid
disruption, which, in turn, might make them uncompetitive in the long run.
Tackling this dilemma distinguishes successful firms and how they react to
change or ‘innovation’. For banks, attempts to create new models for the digital
age will wallow unless people and organisations are willing to disrupt
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fintech affects or disrupts the financial sector in many ways which are beyond
our supposition. For instance, the mechanism which works behind the software of
chatbots is designed to capture natural language and human interactions through
machine learning and artificial intelligence. They assist banks to direct
customers to relevant departments more efficiently while handling queries.
Leading banks in Japan have chatbots that guide customers to information on its
website. Erica, the Bank of America’s chatbot provides investment advice too.
Customer emails containing transaction orders or details can be scanned and
executed within two minutes by robots which would otherwise take over 45
minutes. This process reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction and saves
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big development: a blockchain for digital transactions - cryptocurrency - is triumphing over the financial industry by providing consumers with a
speedier and cheaper way to carry on transactions. According to NASDAQ, the
greatest visible application of blockchain will be in how it moulds the payment
mechanism for the banks and users in order to dwindle away the transaction time.
In addition, with a unique trust system, blockchain offers a complete trading
platform for exchanges of securities which is achieved through transparency,
minimisation of risk, human error and transaction costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of fintech will increase as the next few years will see the
disappearance of the Baby Boomer generation and the coming forth of the
Millennials or Gen Y (people born between 1980-1999). As they gain purchasing
power, they will cause drastic changes in client pattern, behaviour, decision
making, demographics and expectations. Their preference for a state-of-the-art
customer experience, high speed and convenience at the click of a button will
further accelerate the inculcation of fintech solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, digital disruption is not only about the positives. Cyber-crimes are
ever growing (malware, ransomware, phishing, etc.) along with digitisation. So,
stereotyped verification mechanisms are no longer enough to thwart fraudulent
attempts. The answer to this problem also lies in technology. More secure
protocols and extreme and extensive real-time, cross-channel fraud detection
systems are now available to protect the industry. There exists machine Learning
as well as artificial intelligence for disclosure of fraudulent activities. The
security softwares generate alarms on the plausibility of a fraud. Thereupon, it
is up to the investigators to figure out whether the transaction is a false
positive or an actual peril. The adoption of data aggregation floors, machine
learning steered statistical modelling and process automation can revamp
anti-money laundering activities by inculcating advanced efficiencies. Data
aggregation platforms can provide a 360-degree client view and facilitate
speedier transaction validation as already discussed. Further, machine learning
algorithms can leverage historical records to ascertain patterns and foresee the
happening of fraud and attacks, curtailing human endeavour by nearly half of
what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In search of a safe and personal banking experience, as well as applications for
mobile devices, smartphones, and online payments, a new chapter of introducing
financial technologies in the financial services sector is being adopted. Today,
fintech covers everything, from chatbots to customer service, from machine
learning algorithms to blockchains for fraud analysis, from digital transactions
to biometrics. Retail banks have become a new player in providing all this to
their customers, forcing traditional banks to strategically invest in innovative
technologies. All of this will eventually lead to higher consumer retention.
While fintech, like any other technology, brings with it its set of disruptions,
the best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sailesh.buchasia unnati.jain</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">The world stands on the brink of a 4th industrial revolution that will fundamentally alter the way everyone functions, which includes the complete disruption of many industries and their business models.

At the intersection of finance and technology lies this altering phenomenon, Fintech, which has been accelerating the pace of change at a remarkable rate and is reshaping the industry’s status quo. ‘Fintech’ is a term that has become the new trend in the media and in technology circles. Yet, despite being widely discussed, many – including tech-savvy and clued-up entrepreneurs – don’t quite have a handle on it. While traditionally fintech was used for back-office functions to help banks manage customer databases, facilitate transactions and record accounts, today it has DIY modes where customers have a plethora of digital platforms at their disposal, almost eliminating their dependence on a brick and mortar bank. With 24/7 device-sceptic access, virtually every transaction is now digitally possible. The relevance of having several brick and mortar bank branches is reducing as banking permeates all digital channels (cell phones, social and online channels). According to some studies, in the European Union itself, more than nine thousand bank branches were closed at the end of 2016 due to the wider introduction of electronic payments and online/mobile banking. Digital Disruption: What next? Legacy financial institutions looking to become digitally-enabled encounter two main problems. First, the business models and personal skills that have been imbibed in the industry for decades have been disrupted by digital innovation, and no longer hold the same degree of importance in the new banking ecosystem. Second is “the innovator’s dilemma”. The innovator’s dilemma implies that when companies adopt new technology and allocate the resources accordingly, they end up disrupting the existing methods, something which they were already nurturing. Hence, they might prefer to focus resources on existing methods to avoid disruption, which, in turn, might make them uncompetitive in the long run. Tackling this dilemma distinguishes successful firms and how they react to change or ‘innovation’. For banks, attempts to create new models for the digital age will wallow unless people and organisations are willing to disrupt themselves. Fintech affects or disrupts the financial sector in many ways which are beyond our supposition. For instance, the mechanism which works behind the software of chatbots is designed to capture natural language and human interactions through machine learning and artificial intelligence. They assist banks to direct customers to relevant departments more efficiently while handling queries. Leading banks in Japan have chatbots that guide customers to information on its website. Erica, the Bank of America’s chatbot provides investment advice too. Customer emails containing transaction orders or details can be scanned and executed within two minutes by robots which would otherwise take over 45 minutes. This process reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction and saves time. The next big development: a blockchain for digital transactions - cryptocurrency - is triumphing over the financial industry by providing consumers with a speedier and cheaper way to carry on transactions. According to NASDAQ, the greatest visible application of blockchain will be in how it moulds the payment mechanism for the banks and users in order to dwindle away the transaction time. In addition, with a unique trust system, blockchain offers a complete trading platform for exchanges of securities which is achieved through transparency, minimisation of risk, human error and transaction costs. The importance of fintech will increase as the next few years will see the disappearance of the Baby Boomer generation and the coming forth of the Millennials or Gen Y (people born between 1980-1999). As they gain purchasing power, they will cause drastic changes in client pattern, behaviour, decision making, demographics and expectations. Their preference for a state-of-the-art customer experience, high speed and convenience at the click of a button will further accelerate the inculcation of fintech solutions. However, digital disruption is not only about the positives. Cyber-crimes are ever growing (malware, ransomware, phishing, etc.) along with digitisation. So, stereotyped verification mechanisms are no longer enough to thwart fraudulent attempts. The answer to this problem also lies in technology. More secure protocols and extreme and extensive real-time, cross-channel fraud detection systems are now available to protect the industry. There exists machine Learning as well as artificial intelligence for disclosure of fraudulent activities. The security softwares generate alarms on the plausibility of a fraud. Thereupon, it is up to the investigators to figure out whether the transaction is a false positive or an actual peril. The adoption of data aggregation floors, machine learning steered statistical modelling and process automation can revamp anti-money laundering activities by inculcating advanced efficiencies. Data aggregation platforms can provide a 360-degree client view and facilitate speedier transaction validation as already discussed. Further, machine learning algorithms can leverage historical records to ascertain patterns and foresee the happening of fraud and attacks, curtailing human endeavour by nearly half of what it was. In search of a safe and personal banking experience, as well as applications for mobile devices, smartphones, and online payments, a new chapter of introducing financial technologies in the financial services sector is being adopted. Today, fintech covers everything, from chatbots to customer service, from machine learning algorithms to blockchains for fraud analysis, from digital transactions to biometrics. Retail banks have become a new player in providing all this to their customers, forcing traditional banks to strategically invest in innovative technologies. All of this will eventually lead to higher consumer retention. While fintech, like any other technology, brings with it its set of disruptions, the best is yet to come.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">United in Pay, Divided in Dues</title><link href="/United-in-pay" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="United in Pay, Divided in Dues" /><published>2019-05-03T02:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-03T02:14:00+00:00</updated><id>/United-in-pay</id><content type="html" xml:base="/United-in-pay">&lt;p&gt;India’s Jet Airways may have shut down all operations, but they are not the only
ones with their international business up in flames due to a financial crisis.
The United Nations has been jostling with its latest set of money problems as
well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not been living under a rock for the past couple of weeks, you must
have already come across numerous articles like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmicdc.com/about-DMICDC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images//united-in-pay-1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every publication on the Internet that you could think of has been
reeling from this news and successfully copy-pasting news from one another.
Whichever side you look at, whatever your source is, it does not make a
difference. There have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moYojoQsedU&quot;&gt;YouTube
videos&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook posts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hJzKSJCtn8&quot;&gt;TV
monologues&lt;/a&gt; and private rants about
it. The same thing, boxed up and packaged differently, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ok! The United Nations owes India money, lots of money. Now get over it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the discussion is that it is pointed in the wrong direction and
the whole narrative is messed up. To be honest, the United Nations is not really
at fault here. When you have a situation like this, news consumers tend to
simplify the news in their terms and react to it in the most primitive way
possible: by losing their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmicdc.com/about-DMICDC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images//united-in-pay-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s get down to business. The United Nations is under a financial
crisis of unusual proportions. It is facing severe shortages in its Regular
Budget compensation, as well as its Peacekeeping Budget, which is the main
reason why they are finding it tough to repay their dues to the
Police-Contributing Countries (PCCs) and Troop-Contributing Countries (TCCs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of the beginning of April 2019, the United Nations is yet to complete $256
million in total payments, with the likes of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan
and Rwanda each being &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/un-owes-india-usd-38-million-for-peacekeeping-operations-unsg-report/articleshow/68904063.cms&quot;&gt;owed $23-38
million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation has a direct link with the state of the United Nations’ cash
balance, which has fallen by $735 million since the beginning of the decade. It
currently stands at an abysmal -$323 million (yes, the minus sign is a negative
balance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could such a dangerous cash crunch bite the UN at this point of time? To
understand things, we have to get a better understanding of the way the UN gets
its money to function. It is a bit complex, but if you know basic maths and
possess an above-average attention span, then you will definitely get a grip of
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it works like this. The United Nations decides the amount that each country
should pay to the Regular Budget, based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gnp.mktp.cd&quot;&gt;Gross National Income
(GNI)&lt;/a&gt; of the respective
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then makes a series of adjustments based on the amount of external debt of
the country, whether the country has a very low per-capita GNI and if it belongs
to the list of Least Developed Countries or not. If so, the contributions by the
country will be capped at 0.01% of the total budget. Also, every country must
pay at least 0.001% of the budget, called the minimum pay adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and lastly, if a country’s share exceeds 22%, it will be brought down to and
capped at 22% of the total budget amount. The United States whose estimated
share is 23.069% is the only country that is getting a discount, in having to
pay only 22%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a great infographic from &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/author/ashendrukqz/&quot;&gt;Amanda

perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shohan Mukherjee</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">India’s Jet Airways may have shut down all operations, but they are not the only ones with their international business up in flames due to a financial crisis.

YouTube. Out of the hundreds of videos of finger-snapping and rants over love,
loss, oppression, and identity, it was her name that stuck, long after my fiery
infatuation with spoken word poetry had mellowed to a flicker. I always
gravitate back to this opinionated, curly-haired woman who writes about Manic
Pixie Dream Girls, resting b*tch faces, period underwear and stories of girls
putting in tampons for their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her writing reflects a wave of feminism which has a ferocious insistence on
&lt;em&gt;reclaiming&lt;/em&gt; femininity with unwavering pride. Olivia doesn’t spend time
clarifying that pink isn’t every woman’s favourite colour, she would much rather
illustrate through poetry the beauty and loveliness of pink, and how there
cannot be shame in loving something that is beautiful. The idea behind
reclamation is to tell-off the patriarchy, by stripping away the shame,
weakness, and unimportance that it attaches to womanliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Imagine, the teen girls gone from our world and how quickly we would beg for
their return.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing about girlhood, Olivia advocates for the fact that stories of
girlhood are in fact important enough to be given a name, to be archived and
shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had a love affair with Olivia’s poetry and with her determined conviction
to speak to the teenage girl in me or in any woman. And in all their might,
those words have loved me back too, by bringing me tales of valiant and
interesting women in a world that has only ever painted us as meek and doe-eyed,
and by bringing pride to places that had only known shame. Olivia tells me how
uniquely wonderful the friendship between two teen girls is and I recall all of
those moments of unbelievable intimacy that I had taken for granted. She tells
me about the careless trust she places on old period underwear and my mind
wanders back to every red splotch, together with the vicious scrubbing and the
unnecessary hiding. She talks of the profoundness of female rituals and suddenly
nothing about my existence as a teen girl is mundane to me. With her poetry,
every mundane experience of girlhood evolves into a sacrosanct ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I had never pined, so badly,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;for denim to slip down her lower back,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;upon taking a seat,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;to reveal the fuzz along her spine,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;that which she likely wished to remove,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;begged her mother for hot wax like we all did&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia paints a collage of details, she doesn’t &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; you that queerness is a
beautiful thing, instead she makes you feel a thousand flapping butterflies for
a girl’s fuzzy lower back, and by the end of it you have &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; that queerness
is indeed a beautiful thing, you don’t have to be told anymore. It’s not a poem
of some gigantic struggle for LGBTQ emancipation. Instead, it is one that
combines the smallest of elements, eliciting the most primitive, the most human
of responses, and establishing connectedness in the process. The constant
non-linearity in her writing is what sets her apart from the surge of spoken
word poets, whose poems are more declarative in form. Olivia will let her words
find you at a leisurely pace and gradually engulf you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of excessive interaction with content, it is easy to become
desensitised to words. Words, as they are, fall short in being able to evoke
fury or love or even solidarity. What then, induces one to drop one’s thoughts
and feel something? Olivia speaks to that desensitised reader/listener through
the entangling net of stories that she weaves. She reminds one that poetry isn’t
a dish to be served on a platter but rather a recipe to be navigated through,
half the fun lies in disentangling the net that the author weaves. Quite unlike
the Rupi Kaur brand of poetry. For Kaur gives a perfectly fitting feminist
message, but that’s it. Her poetry exists merely on the surface, there is
nothing to delve into, to be submerged in. This narrative moves forward in a
straight line, such that there is no space left &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the lines, which is
also the space where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The last time we made love you asked me if I was scared,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think you wanted me to say yes”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtlety is also Olivia’s distinguishing quality. Even in poems with darker
undertones, in stories of pain and abuse, she often speaks about the abuse
without ever outrightly addressing it. And strangely enough, the indistinction
encapsulates the very nature of abuse itself, to be so subtle that we wish to
ignore it. How abuse isn’t usually isolated and identifiable, but it’s in words,
actions and behaviours interlaced with all else, how it is indistinguishable to
the extent that it almost resembles normalcy. She brings out the imperceptible
fears that lurk within us. Olivia gets the grey nature of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The boy doesn’t ask if he can choke me, so I pretend to die while he’s doing
it”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the curator to the museum of all our stories, some lost and some broken,
what’s different is the light that she uses to guide us through them. A light of
pride. She leaves one with not only the feeling that poetry is magical but that
being a girl itself is so so wondrous and sensationally beautiful in nature.
Olivia is about the details, about the fears and insecurities in the experiences
of girlhood, and the understanding that from the smallest instances emerges the
greatest solidarity. Being a girl can be a constant struggle for selfhood.
Everything teenage girls do and are is under constant attack and ridicule. And
that is precisely how patriarchy is structured, that even a single moment of
uninterrupted female existence is unendurable for them. And to that, she says,
f*ck you.&lt;/p&gt;

my p*ssy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stuti Gupta</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Olivia Gatwood was a name I stumbled upon in a vast sea of slam poetry videos on YouTube.

our rooms. It’s not unheard of for a person to take a day off and do nothing,
but then, we all have a limit to all or any of it. After a while, someone is
probably going to call out for you, you’ll probably have made a plan you forgot
about, or someone just visits you. It’d be a surprise if you said you had not
talked to anyone all day, whether virtually or in real life. But, that’s exactly
what is going on in several countries, most notably in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard of the word &lt;em&gt;hikikomori&lt;/em&gt; before, don’t worry, I hadn’t
either. Just the other day, I was made aware of how our generation is the most
depressed one and I went surfing on the web to check the validity of that
statement. What I found was this ominous term. When one mentions “&lt;em&gt;hikikomori&lt;/em&gt;”,
the immediate image that comes to mind is a young Japanese man, who has isolated
himself within a bedroom in his parents’ house for years on end, refusing to
speak, interact, or even be seen by anyone – sometimes including his own family.
Meals are brought to the door a few times a day, and garbage and other refuse
are left out in return. He might have started off spending his time playing
video games or chatting online, but those activities have lost their charm long
ago. He now simply stares off into space. &lt;em&gt;Hikikomori&lt;/em&gt;. The world of perfect
isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the diversity of traits and characteristics accompanying
&lt;em&gt;hikikomori&lt;/em&gt;, much effort has been put into defining the term in a way that
consolidates the condition that we are examining.  It is a term that describes
both the state and the sufferer of acute social withdrawal. It means the
behaviour in which adolescents and young adults refuse all contact with society
and withdraw from all social activities. First coined by psychiatrist Tamaki
Saito in 1998 in his book &lt;em&gt;Social Withdrawal – Adolescence Without End&lt;/em&gt;, the
term and the condition gained immense popularity in Japan following several
newspaper articles and television interviews with Saito. The Japanese government
officially defines hikikomori as people who haven’t left their homes or
interacted with others for at least six months. They’re often dubbed as
modern-day hermits. The best behavioural definition to date was proposed by Teo
and Gaw in 2010, this definition of &lt;em&gt;hikikomori&lt;/em&gt; captures the core constructs
associated with the condition in six criteria. For one, most of the day, nearly
every day, is spent at home. The person persistently avoids social situations
and social relationships. They are bound to have experienced distress or
impairment in their normal routine, for a duration of at least six months. The
last, but an important criterion is that the condition is not better explained
by another psychiatric disorder such as social phobia, major depressive
disorders, schizophrenia, or avoidant personality disorder. We define this kind
of hikikomori as “primary hikikomori”, i.e. one manifestation of the hikikomori
phenomenon that cannot be described using current concepts in psychiatric
disease. Primary hikikomori youth do not have any serious diagnosable
psychopathology, yet they are unable to enter society or adapt to their
surroundings. Hikikomori can also include individuals suffering from a variety
of severe mental disorders including affective disorder, anxiety disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, and pervasive
developmental disorders, but they are classified as “secondary hikikomori”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, hikikomori was simply a general term referring to a condition in
which people withdrew from relationships with others. It was also used as a
psychiatric term describing the symptom of withdrawal in autistic,
schizophrenic, depressive or aged patients. After 1990, hikikomori among youth
received increasing attention from psychiatrists and society-at-large and came
to be used mainly for describing young adults. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/magazine/shutting-themselves-in.html&quot;&gt;According to The New York
Times&lt;/a&gt;,
doctors began to observe hikikomori as a social phenomenon around the mid-1980s,
when young men exhibited signs of lethargy, refusing to communicate and spending
most of their time in their rooms. Canadian journalist Michael Zielenziger’s
book &lt;em&gt;Shutting Out the Sun&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ article “Shutting
Themselves In” put the word on the map for the rest of us. The Saito book –
&lt;em&gt;Social Withdrawal – Adolescence Without End&lt;/em&gt;, in itself, gives us a good idea
about how the word came to be. The hikikomori are rebellious, they need to be
cared for and they’re financially dependent on their parents. It is difficult to
find one cause or reason behind this condition. They are troubled by their
future and are unable to cope with the uncertainty. They may have been triggered
by some trauma; statistics suggest bullying as a major cause. The pressure of it
all: to maintain the family name, to maintain your own dignity, everything may
be a trigger and also a facilitator. The phenomenon can come in various forms: A
person’s condition can be so severe that they lack the energy to leave their
sofa to go to the toilet, another could suffer from obsessive-compulsive
disorders so serious that they shower several hours a day or scrub their shower
tiles for hours, some may just play video games all day- “as if it would
tranquilise me.” Some just lay in wait for ‘energy’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A community‐based survey published in 2010 reported that the prevalence of
hikikomori stood at approximately 1.2% of the Japanese population, and in 2016 a
Japanese cabinet report estimated people with hikikomori to be number over half
a million within the age range of 15‐39 years. The country now hopes to identify
older hikikomori and understand the assistance their families need. As
hikikomori grow older and their parents become too elderly to care for them,
questions over their fate will become more urgent. There’s also an implied
consensus that hikikomori are generally men, which might not be true. In fact,
the very number mentioned might be incorrect. Several families don’t like to
accept the reality and call it what it is and instead just say that their
children are being ‘selfish’ for some time. The females, in Japanese culture,
are already supposed to be shy and introverted, so when they shirk away from
social interaction, nobody views it as anything out of the ordinary. What is
absurd is how many parents albeit aware of what’s occurring channel the truth in
a fashion that fits right with their reality. In Japanese, there’s a very famous
saying, “A protruding nail will be hammered down.” And that is what may be the
reason why this phenomenon is overtaking the Japanese population. Japan is soon
to face what they call the “2030 problem”. As many with the condition are
getting older and staying withdrawn for longer, the concern is that in 12 years
many hikikomori will approach their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/men-how-to-dress-your-age-60s-and-beyond&quot;&gt;60s&lt;/a&gt;
and will have no family to support them – making reintegration into society much
harder. Additionally, as more people withdraw from society and stop working, the
fear is that Japan’s economy will also suffer—which it is already doing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when there is a problem, there is a solution. Psychiatrists have
tried to treat hikikomori with individual therapy, group therapy, family
therapy, and family group therapy. Solutions have also come in the form of a
non-profit organisation called New Start, which runs a programme called Rental
Sister, where volunteers visit hikikomori houses. It’s been said that it can
take up to two years of visits to get some cases to leave their homes.
Currently, there are more than fifty government‐funded community support centres
for hikikomori located throughout the prefectures of Japan, providing services
such as telephone consultations for family members, the creation of “meeting
spaces” for affected people, and job placement support. In addition, various
private institutions provide treatment for hikikomori sufferers. However, there
is yet to be a unified evidence‐based method for these public/private
interventions. A four‐step intervention is recommended by the government
guidelines for hikikomori, including family support and first contact with the
individual followed by his/her evaluation; individual support; training through
an intermediate‐transient group situation (such as group therapy); and social
participation trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese sociocultural background has been traditionally permeated by
“&lt;em&gt;amae”&lt;/em&gt; (accepting over-dependent behaviours) and shame, which may underlie
hikikomori. Parent‐child relationships in Japan have long been considered less
oedipal than in Western societies. They can be marked by an absent father and an
extremely prolonged and close bond with the mother, which may result in
difficulties when it comes to becoming independent. Especially in hikikomori,
the development of basic interpersonal skills during the early stages of life
seems to be insufficient, which can induce vulnerability to stress in later
school/workplace environments and lead to escape from social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hikikomori‐like cases have recently been reported in other countries of varying
sociocultural and economic backgrounds such as Hong Kong, Oman, was and Spain,
and studies have revealed its existence in India, South Korea, and the US. Thus,
one can say that hikikomori has now crossed the limits of a culture‐bound
phenomenon to become an increasingly prevalent international condition. A major
contributing factor may be the evolution of communication from direct to
increasingly indirect and physically-isolating forms. This is especially the
case for social interactions which hitherto required face‐to‐face contacts in a
mutual physical space but can now occur, at least partially, in a virtual world.
Internet addiction has been reported in several countries. In South Korea, for
example, it is said to be a serious problem among adolescents. It is said that
the “recluse type” Internet addicts do not leave home not only because they are
totally absorbed in the Internet, but also because they have a tendency to avoid
communication with others. In England, young people not in full-time education,
employment or training (NEET) are the subject of policy concern.  This
phenomenon is similar to hikikomori behaviourally in that the NEET do not work
or study. Japan is very different from India so one cannot actually say that
Indians suffer through what can be construed as exactly Hikikomori. However,
there are several similarities. Indians, too are &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/&quot;&gt;increasingly
overworked&lt;/a&gt;,
with most of the workers &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/&quot;&gt;burning
out&lt;/a&gt;
from unhealthy conditions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134&quot;&gt;Indians too are
lonely&lt;/a&gt;
and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the
actual problem that the dating culture in India is heavily flawed, and the fact
that most men are unlikely to be well-socialised with women – who watch movies
about romance and start to wonder why their lives don’t match up with what’s on
screen. Like the Japanese, Indians also have strong family structures, so that
an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn’t uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we hear the word, we don’t sense that it may be a confusing, cluster-f*ck
of a phenomenon. There’s no one way for us to discern this or solve it. There
are people who’ve recovered and gone on to get married, some even to their
‘rental-sisters.’ But then there are also hikikomori who have been in this
condition for the last 20 years and do not have any desire to come out of it.
The worst case scenario is that there are more than half a million people who
aren’t even aware of their condition. Animes like &lt;em&gt;Welcome to NHK&lt;/em&gt; and movies
about Hikikomori may give us a visual on how hikikomori may feel. One of the
quotes from &lt;em&gt;Welcome to NHK&lt;/em&gt; especially made a mark on me- &lt;em&gt;“To a hikikomori,
winter is painful because everything feels cold, frozen over, and lonely. To a
hikikomori, spring is also painful because everyone is in a good mood and
therefore enviable. Summer, of course, is especially painful…”&lt;/em&gt; Maika Elan has
an amazing range of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/amp/s/relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/photography/proof/2018/february/japan-hikikomori-isolation-society&quot;&gt;photographs&lt;/a&gt;
which showcase a spectrum of this phenomenon—from the ones who are new, the ones
who have faced it for decades, to the ones who have recovered. It’s worth a
glance and may give you a lot of fodder for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a scary time for all of us. Even though we have measures to have constant
communication, it almost seems like we are stepping away from socialising. And
the more that we do so, the more it seems to do more harm than good. It is true
for all of us that we keep touch in ways that may come as shallow. The world has
always been a machine but the ‘chewing out’ and ‘burning out’ cycle seems to
have increased its pace. It is a positive step that social impairment or
problems with social connections are finally being looked at as health issues.
But that’s the best one can ask for, for now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harshita Jain</name></author><category term="society" /><summary type="html">I’m sure we’ve all had days when we don’t want to leave the house, perhaps even our rooms. It’s not unheard of for a person to take a day off and do nothing, but then, we all have a limit to all or any of it. After a while, someone is probably going to call out for you, you’ll probably have made a plan you forgot about, or someone just visits you. It’d be a surprise if you said you had not talked to anyone all day, whether virtually or in real life. But, that’s exactly what is going on in several countries, most notably in Japan. If you haven’t heard of the word hikikomori before, don’t worry, I hadn’t either. Just the other day, I was made aware of how our generation is the most depressed one and I went surfing on the web to check the validity of that statement. What I found was this ominous term. When one mentions “hikikomori”, the immediate image that comes to mind is a young Japanese man, who has isolated himself within a bedroom in his parents’ house for years on end, refusing to speak, interact, or even be seen by anyone – sometimes including his own family. Meals are brought to the door a few times a day, and garbage and other refuse are left out in return. He might have started off spending his time playing video games or chatting online, but those activities have lost their charm long ago. He now simply stares off into space. Hikikomori. The world of perfect isolation. Because of the diversity of traits and characteristics accompanying hikikomori, much effort has been put into defining the term in a way that consolidates the condition that we are examining.  It is a term that describes both the state and the sufferer of acute social withdrawal. It means the behaviour in which adolescents and young adults refuse all contact with society and withdraw from all social activities. First coined by psychiatrist Tamaki Saito in 1998 in his book Social Withdrawal – Adolescence Without End, the term and the condition gained immense popularity in Japan following several newspaper articles and television interviews with Saito. The Japanese government officially defines hikikomori as people who haven’t left their homes or interacted with others for at least six months. They’re often dubbed as modern-day hermits. The best behavioural definition to date was proposed by Teo and Gaw in 2010, this definition of hikikomori captures the core constructs associated with the condition in six criteria. For one, most of the day, nearly every day, is spent at home. The person persistently avoids social situations and social relationships. They are bound to have experienced distress or impairment in their normal routine, for a duration of at least six months. The last, but an important criterion is that the condition is not better explained by another psychiatric disorder such as social phobia, major depressive disorders, schizophrenia, or avoidant personality disorder. We define this kind of hikikomori as “primary hikikomori”, i.e. one manifestation of the hikikomori phenomenon that cannot be described using current concepts in psychiatric disease. Primary hikikomori youth do not have any serious diagnosable psychopathology, yet they are unable to enter society or adapt to their surroundings. Hikikomori can also include individuals suffering from a variety of severe mental disorders including affective disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, and pervasive developmental disorders, but they are classified as “secondary hikikomori”. Originally, hikikomori was simply a general term referring to a condition in which people withdrew from relationships with others. It was also used as a psychiatric term describing the symptom of withdrawal in autistic, schizophrenic, depressive or aged patients. After 1990, hikikomori among youth received increasing attention from psychiatrists and society-at-large and came to be used mainly for describing young adults. According to The New York Times, doctors began to observe hikikomori as a social phenomenon around the mid-1980s, when young men exhibited signs of lethargy, refusing to communicate and spending most of their time in their rooms. Canadian journalist Michael Zielenziger’s book Shutting Out the Sun and the New York Times’ article “Shutting Themselves In” put the word on the map for the rest of us.

The 41-year old will be Ukraine’s youngest President, with a sweeping victory that comprised 73% of the vote share. The star of The Servant of the People sitcom got the chance of a lifetime as he transitioned from the ‘reel’ to the ‘real’. Zelensky has often been referred to as the ‘Ukrainian Trump’, precisely because of him being a political novice and acquiring the highest public office. With Trump and Zelensky around, the big question is what do the ‘newbies’ have in store for international diplomacy and the world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible implication could be a newer perspective to domestic as well as foreign politics. In an interview in December 2018, Zelensky stressed on ending the ongoing War in Donbass by negotiating with Russia. This is in stark contrast to the policy steered by the previous President Petro Poroshenko. Moreover, his election campaign targeted voters online, and through social media, ditching conventional campaigning in the form of rallies and interviews. His experiments did bear fruit as he emerged victorious, becoming the youngest President in the history of the nation. Similarly, Trump’s somewhat right-wing nationalist construct had significant impacts on both the domestic and international front. His ‘America First’ policy stood diametrically opposed to the longstanding pro-globalisation policy. And his silent acquiescence to white supremacists and major disregard for feminist movements have challenged the American ideals of inclusiveness and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would believe a political neophyte brings fresher waves in the working of the bureaucracy. Their ideas, derived from their work experience in a non-government sector, bring in a newer set of work ethics, for better or for worse. The Ukrainians voted for Zelensky because of his promise to fight corruption, which seemed unlikely with the ‘oligarch’ Poroshenko. One of Zelensky’s prominent poll promises was of crowdsourcing important appointments and policies, making the administrative setup truly democratic. This may be a groundbreaking idea, given that the public sector universally suffers from elitism and is blamed for poor transparency in its functioning. Trump’s official economic advisors have included the elites of business and finance, with negligible government or academic experience. The appointments are justified by the fact that big names of the private sector have much more practical exposure to real-life business and economics over academicians. While the impact of these changes is yet to be assessed, this could be an excellent case study for public sectors across the globe to emulate–if it really shakes things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newbies put forward an interesting opportunity for governments: new strategic alliances can be forged and existing alliances can go for a toss. In Trump’s case, we have witnessed the case of the Iran Nuclear Deal. Formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the withdrawal of the US from the Deal heightened tensions with the pro-deal European Union. In addition, both are engaged in a tussle over defense spending on NATO. Reportedly, Trump plans to withdraw from the military body in 2019. This would strike a blow to the partnership that carried out ambitious missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya. Moreover, the President’s soft-corner for Kremlin, in the face of Mueller investigation has raised many eyebrows. In our Ukrainian protagonist’s case, the hypothesis of radical foreign policy changes cannot be rejected, given his willingness to also “make a deal” with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature about the working of newbies is that as they begin their work, they start with a clean slate: no prior experience of governance. This can be a boon, which can result in out-of-the box and creative solutions to administrative bottlenecks. This can further refine relationships between the executive, judiciary and legislature. Political newbies enjoy a unique advantage over their politically-active counterparts—they have no track record. It may not make sense at the first go, but is, in fact, a great strength. People have known the latter for quite a long time, a career politician’s ideologies and way of working are constantly exposed to the public eye. Anti-incumbency is easy to creep in and vote swings are common. However, a novice is judged by his intent, not past performance. In most of these cases, people would prefer to give the new face with promising plans a chance. Zelensky won because of this psychological phenomenon. As did Trump with his firebrand nationalist rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was inaugurated as President in January 2017. More than two years have passed by, with an eventful international arena. From trade wars with China to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, there has been a lot the world order has had to process. President Trump has been criticised for his thoughtless and confrontational foreign policy. The decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem has been seen as an appeal to the Jewish vote bank, that Trump seems to enjoy back home. The US pulled out of UNESCO in January 2019, in protest of the organisation’s ‘Anti-Israel’ bias. Failure of the Second Peace Talks with North Korea in Vietnam also points to the same confrontational design that his policies have been accused of. But, admittedly, the political newbie has brought tremors and movements to world politics that have not been since the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel Macron, another political novice was elected as the President of France in 2017. He is the founder of the political movement “En Marche!”, and won against the right-wing Marine Le Pen. As opposed to Trump, Macron’s foreign policy has been observed as ‘accommodative’ and ‘cooperative’. From Climate Change to a secure Indo-Pacific, Macron has been known for his decisive contribution to international diplomacy. However, at the domestic front, he has faced a backlash in the form of Yellow Vest Protests against high taxes on Gasoline. In December 2018, his approval ratings fell to 23%, following the poor handling of the Protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be unwise to say that the political movements across the world have nothing specifically to do with the age and the field of the leader. Leaders can emerge from all walks of life. From the victory of Zelensky, a comedian, to Imran Khan changing the pitch from cricket to politics, the newbies have been quite successful in their endeavours. It might just have to do with the fact that there are always limitations to imagination and career politicians get stale after a point of time. The aspirations of this generation lie with the hope of a faster system and a transparent one. People from the other side of the spectrum are often required to remind the ‘grey-haired’ dinosaurs of what the society really wants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gurleen Kaur</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">Ukraine is now a hot topic in international news due to the historic victory of comedian Volodymyr Zelensky in its Presidential elections.

It is no doubt that these topics will be sticking out as the major drivers of
the 2019 Indian election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at some data that will give us some insight into the State of the
Nation. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&amp;amp;dt=2019-01-08%2009:28:37&amp;amp;msec=666&quot;&gt;Centre for Monitoring Indian
Economy&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmie.com/kommon/bin/sr.php?kall=warticle&amp;amp;dt=2019-01-08%2009:28:37&amp;amp;msec=666&quot;&gt;CMIE&lt;/a&gt;)
estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/surveying-indias-unemployment-numbers/article26218615.ece&quot;&gt;11 million
jobs&lt;/a&gt;
were lost in 2018 – pushing the unemployment rate to 7.38%. A leaked NSSO report
pegged the unemployment rate at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/unemployment-rate-at-four-decade-high-nsso-survey-compared-past-figures-119020100042_1.html&quot;&gt;6.1%&lt;/a&gt;,
the highest in over four decades. Things do not look so good for our youth at
work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the farmers, the bedrock of our society? Well, this is where
things go further downhill. According to Wholesale Price Index
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/india/producer-prices-change&quot;&gt;WPI&lt;/a&gt;) data for the
month of December released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the WPI
sub-component for primary food articles has been negative for six consecutive
months beginning July 2018. This is a direct indication of the sliding prices
that farmers have been facing for their produce, which has led to innumerable
suicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women’s safety is also experiencing issues that India cannot seem to get away
from that have been lingering for far too long and are only getting worse.
According to a recent poll of 548 experts by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://poll2018.trust.org/country/?id=india&quot;&gt;Thomson Reuters
Foundation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“India ranked 1st among the world’s most dangerous countries for women.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No progress here, ladies and gentlemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is dire and the immediate need for change is crystal clear. It is
also understood that this summer the onus is on the people to effect change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can we &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; the voters? How rational are they when it comes to making
decisions? How rational are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where our rant comes to an end and the &lt;em&gt;dissection&lt;/em&gt; begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us play a little game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elections are only about promises and promises do not hold up most of the time,
so we reduce them to a matter of &lt;em&gt;probability&lt;/em&gt;. Now, let’s see how you and your
choices fare in our mock election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let there be two political parties, A and B, standing in the elections. Party A
promises to reduce unemployment by 20%, with a 100% chance of fulfilling his
promise. Whereas, Party B promises to reduce unemployment by 35%, with a 15 out
of 16 chance of fulfilling his promise. To put it neatly,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;20% unemployment drop, with certainty (100% Guarantee).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;35% unemployment reduction, with 15/16 chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go on. Take your pick. Is it party A or party B? Who would you bank on for the
country’s sake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, here’s a second case to choose from.  Party A promises a 20% reduction in
unemployment, only now with a 16% chance of fulfilling his promise. Whereas,
Party B promises 35% fall, with a 15% chance. Restating it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;20% unemployment drop, with a 16% chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;35% unemployment reduction, with a 15% chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whom did you pick? If you happened to pick Party A in Case 1, then you are
like the majority, who prefer certainty over chance. For those who chose Party B
in the first case, you were ready to take the risk for the greater reward. But
there is nothing wrong with either choice, the real game starts with Case 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what about Case 2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here’s the bombshell. Case 2 is equal to Case 1 with a one-sixth chance.
That is, Case 2 is the same situation as Case 1, only with a 16% probability.
The change between the party’s probability of fulfilling promises in both cases
was proportional and thus, renders both cases to be the absolute same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if the problem never changed, did your choice of candidates change? From B to
A, or A to B?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not, then congratulations, you have
rational preferences. If you did, then there are more than a few things at work
here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us try another problem of this sort. Whether or not the government promised
to deposit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/bjp-never-promised-to-deposit-rs-15-lakh-in-people-bank-accounts-rajnath-singh/story/335629.html&quot;&gt;Rs. 15
Lakh&lt;/a&gt;
in everyone’s accounts, it is always possible another party will make a similar
promise in the run-up to the elections. Farmers are definitely in need of severe
financial help, so take Party A and Party B who make the respective
&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/budget-2019-income-support-for-farmers-a-progressive-step-but-not-enough-to-mitigate-stress/articleshow/67802322.cms&quot;&gt;income-support&lt;/a&gt;
promises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rs 11,000 a year, with an 11% chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rs 15,000 a year, with a 10% chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rs 11,000 a year, &lt;b&gt;guaranteed&lt;/b&gt; (100% chance).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rs 15,000 a year, with a 10% chance, and Rs 11,000 a year, with an 89%
chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who gets the vote, in each case, this time around? Did you choose the same party
both times, or different parties? Choosing different parties is a sign of
incoherent decision-making. This is because Case 1 is once again of a similar
form as Case 2. There has been no significant change in the factors that should
influence your decision-making. Yet there will be more than a few instances of
people making unidentical choices for Cases 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to do a bit of explaining. Consider these cases as lotteries. Both Party A
and Party B have an 89% chance of not fulfilling any promise in Case 1. But
wait? Didn’t Party B promise a 10% chance? So it gives us (100% -10%=) 90%
chance of empty-handed farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, there is the existence of a lottery within a lottery; a &lt;strong&gt;compound&lt;/strong&gt;
lottery, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lottery within is actually a 10 out of 11 chance of receiving Rs 15000 and 1
out of 11 chance of getting Rs 0. So when it is nested inside the outer lottery
of Party B, we get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;11% x [( 10/11 x Rs 15000)+(1/11 x Rs 0)]   + 89% x Rs 0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is essentially,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Rs 15,000 a year, with a 10% chance and Rs 0, with a 90% chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, things are getting discombobulated in your head, but stay with me.
Eventually, what we are left with is a much detailed way to re-write and
represent Cases 1 and 2 as &lt;em&gt;nested&lt;/em&gt; probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: 11% x &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Rs 11,000&lt;/span&gt; +   &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;89% x Rs 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;11% x [&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;( 10/11 x Rs 15000)+(1/11 x Rs 0)&lt;/span&gt;]   +  &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;89% x Rs 0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: 11% x &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Rs 11,000&lt;/span&gt; +   &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;89% x Rs 11,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;11% x [&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;( 10/11 x Rs 15000)+(1/11 x Rs 0)&lt;/span&gt;]   + &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;89% x Rs 11,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts marked in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are the actual &lt;em&gt;determinants&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; factors
when it comes to decision-making between the two parties. The segments marked in
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are offered by &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parties and thus, should not be a determining
factor in rational choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you ended up choosing A in Case 1 and B in Case 2 (or vice versa), you
have just chosen two different answers for the same problem. Do you see it now?
That is where rational preferences are violated and we can now find our
&lt;em&gt;irrational voter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this, we come to the origins of the problem. The lack of coherence
empirically observed above is called the &lt;strong&gt;Allais Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;, and has been the
talk of game theorists and psychologists for years. First published in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/pingle/Teaching/BADM%20791/Week%206%20Decision%20Making%20Under%20Uncertainty/Allais%20Paradox%201953.pdf&quot;&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;,
in the &lt;em&gt;Econometrica&lt;/em&gt; journal by French economist Maurice Allais, the Allais
Paradox was observed among subjects who, when presented with choices such as the
ones above, made snap decisions that were proven to be incoherent upon further
study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not everyone got it wrong, a significant number of people made the
error which prompted him to wonder whether there was more than just rationality
behind human choices. So the Allais Paradox started off as more of a standout
against conventional rationality theory, than as the rationality test that it
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zJZvoiwydJ5zvzTHK/the-allais-paradox&quot;&gt;has evolved to
today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maurice Allais did end up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1988/summary/&quot;&gt;winning the 1988 Nobel Prize in
Economics&lt;/a&gt;
but it was not until 20 years after it was first published, that the Allais
Paradox was brought back to the mainstream by Daniel Kahneman. In a way, the
Allais Paradox was what got Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman (2002 Nobel laureate)
into economics. He along with Amos Tversky, were two young psychologists back in
the 1970s who came across this paradox and were so intrigued by the study of
human approach towards uncertainty that they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/S15427579JPFM0402_01&quot;&gt;opened up new
dimensions&lt;/a&gt; in
the world of economics and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/&quot;&gt;decision-making under
uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maurice Allais had made one of the foremost and yet perplexing dives into human
rationality and for that, today, the world is in a better position to understand
human behaviour and decision-making. And while we are on the topic of making
decisions, we get back to the decision of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This election may be driven by 3 &lt;em&gt;central&lt;/em&gt; issues: unemployment, farmers and
women’s protection. But at the end of the day, it is the people who &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt;
elections. Yet what we often overlook is what drives the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; and their
&lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we as smart as we think we are? Does being &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt; only mean being
‘unreasonable’ or ‘baseless’ as the Dictionary says? Or is there more to this
than meets the eye &lt;em&gt;or brain&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, we ask you to think twice before calling someone else irrational.
Oh, and yes, don’t forget to think twice before voting. Happy elections!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*31st May, 2019 marks the 108th Birth Anniversary of French physicist and
economist Maurice Allais, best known for his contributions to the neoclassical
synthesis and the Allais Paradox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shohan Mukherjee</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">The Indian elections are right around the corner and the mood is currently in full swing. Check the papers and you’ll barely find any real estate left for anything else (but you can always check back with The Pangean for more). The juries are out and so are the manifestos. The line between celebrities and candidates gets blurrier by the day and election campaigns are quickly turning into promotional tours. One has to feel sorry for the manifestos, which the majority of voters will probably have only a glance of at most. Studies at the frontiers of decision theory have shown that when people do not pay attention to candidate policy choices, uninformed voters end up making decisions based on personalities. This seems to explain most of the name-calling and on-stage singing that candidates have resorted to. In the midst of all this, three main talking points have emerged: youth unemployment, farmer’s perils and the safety of women. It is no doubt that these topics will be sticking out as the major drivers of the 2019 Indian election. Here’s a look at some data that will give us some insight into the State of the Nation. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) estimated that 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 – pushing the unemployment rate to 7.38%.

The Indian Election Commission in its campaign to encourage citizens to turn up and vote calls them ‘&lt;em&gt;Desh ka Tyohar&lt;/em&gt;’ ( The National Festival). And why not? After all, this is the only time when politicians are knocking on the doors of 900 million eligible voters and not the other way round. For Indians, elections are about debating a host of complex and not-so-complex issues, and then choosing whosoever will deliver the highest standards of living to them. For the rest of the world, Indian elections are about their awe-inspiring size and the grandeur (much like any big Indian wedding). For the Indians living abroad, it is somewhere in between…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is a young country when compared to its more developed Asian peers like China, Japan and Singapore. In the last general elections in 2014, 24 million first-time voters were added to the electoral list. If this number is astounding enough for you, what about the 45 million first-time voters in 2019? This number is larger than the populations of 200 countries (not even kidding). Most of these 45 million voters are aged between 18 to 24. No wonder a lot of campaign issues like unemployment, nationalism under the garb of national security, income guarantees try to capture the imagination of these voters. Politicians are bearing the hot Indian summer, campaigning incessantly, using social media, releasing music videos, and whatnot, to get the youth to their side. What a waste of effort will it be to see many of the youth not voting at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you talk to students in Delhi University (which has the youth coming to study from across India), many are not going to vote for two reasons: one is stupid, and the other is sensible, but not sufficient enough to not vote. Talking about the sensible reason first, the trouble is that of travelling back to their hometowns to vote. Most first-time voters are studying in places far away from their hometowns. For them, travelling back for &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; one day for &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a single vote which ‘&lt;em&gt;won’t even matter&lt;/em&gt;’ is not worth it. Add on to this their stupid reason: they &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; don’t see a suitable candidate to vote for. They dislike the incumbent, they hate the alternatives. You combine these two reasons: of having to travel all way back to your hometown (India is a big country, geographically speaking) only to vote for someone you do not support, and you become sympathetic to their case of not voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem here is that everything is problematic. Voting is NOT a privilege which can be compromised at the cost of personal comfort. There are voters participating in the festival of democracy by braving the gunshots and IED bombs of Maoists. These villagers are warned by local Naxalites to vote only at the expense of losing their lives, not to mention the election officials and security personnel who facilitate the voting in these remote areas, often at the cost of their lives. The State is making attempts to make sure every eligible citizen votes in the elections. Their work has stretched from setting up a polling booth specifically for one person in the middle of the Gir forest in western India amongst Asiatic Lions to election officials walking through knee-deep snow for 45 kilometers in the Himalayas with their election equipment for a meagre 37 voters. Oppressed women and Dalits fight their oppressors to exercise their franchise independently, every time they are asked to not vote or vote for a particular political party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these examples do not hit the young Indian’s “Lutyens’ Delhi” conscience, then the idea of voting should. A vote is an expression of freedom. It symbolises a free people living in a free land - a luxury not all human beings can enjoy. From being labelled “unfit to govern ourselves” by the British (White Man’s Burden, remember?), which became an excuse to oppress millions of people before independence to doomsayers predicting our Balkanisation after independence, an Indian’s vote is a slap to every coloniser or India-skeptic who ever questioned our right to nationhood. It is not, I repeat, a luxury. Lastly, young India’s vote determines India’s future. But, who cares? Saving a few Rupees on travel cost and having ‘exam prep’ is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the young, educated Indian’s attitude brings with it ironies which should be pointed out. How can we complain of the lack of young politicians when the youth does not prioritise engaging in democratic practices? How can we complain of lack of alternatives (the stupid excuse to not vote) when the youth does not care about the nation’s future? Aren’t our politicians a reflection of the society, no matter how skewed the reflection is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, 281 million registered voters did not vote. To give you some perspective, ‘only’ 183 million voters are registered in the US- the world’s second largest democracy. It is as if a whole nation did not vote. 2014 was a wave election when the country was inspired by an ambitious leader. Voters also, for the first time, had the option to vote NOTA (None of the Above). Hence, the number of people opting not to exercise their franchise, in 2019, is expected to be larger. While high voter turnouts in percentage terms show how much faith Indians have in democracy, what is being argued here is the reason(s) to not vote of a very important section of the society is deplorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is a young democracy. As we mature, we are bringing more reforms to our democratic setup. NOTA was one such reform. NOTA gives the ‘frustrated’ voter to register his anti-establishment sentiment in an established way. How many countries can take pride in this? While NOTA has been criticised for its ‘impotence’ (even if NOTA has most votes in a constituency, the candidate with highest votes still gets elected), it is a step in the right direction. Reform does not come in one go, but only gradually. If NOTA’s vote share keeps on rising, as it has since being introduced, policymakers might be tempted to give it its due potency a few general elections down the line. There are still more reforms which can be discussed but won’t be due to lack of space, like the Right to Recall or the introduction of a ‘Proportionate Representation System’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the above-mentioned reforms, ideas like proxy voting, postal ballots, online voting and setting up ‘voting centers’ to enable those who live away from their hometowns to vote in their city of stay are being floated around. In fact, the &lt;em&gt;Times of India&lt;/em&gt; has started a petition called ‘Lost Votes’ to bring to the government’s notice the need to enable voting from the place of residence. Change will come but who will bring the change? &lt;em&gt;The leaders of tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. What are &lt;em&gt;the leaders of tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; doing? Thinking of the &lt;em&gt;Right to Vote&lt;/em&gt; to be a &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an appeal to all those first-time voters who have been caught in the inertia of everyday life. Remember, if we don’t change anything, then nothing will change. It is time we change the system &lt;em&gt;by being a part of it&lt;/em&gt; rather than being a part of it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the system reforms itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vidyarthi</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">The elections are, literally speaking, a celebration in India. The Indian Election Commission in its campaign to encourage citizens to turn up and vote calls them ‘Desh ka Tyohar’ ( The National Festival). And why not? After all, this is the only time when politicians are knocking on the doors of 900 million eligible voters and not the other way round. For Indians, elections are about debating a host of complex and not-so-complex issues, and then choosing whosoever will deliver the highest standards of living to them. For the rest of the world, Indian elections are about their awe-inspiring size and the grandeur (much like any big Indian wedding). For the Indians living abroad, it is somewhere in between…</summary></entry></feed>
